<h1>Flare Finance</h1>

<p> 
Flare Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for XRP, LTC and Flare holders. </p>

<p>Currently, most of the information is about the airdrop. </p>

<h2>Airdrop </h2>

<p>Flare Finance will airdrop YFLR to holders of Spark Token/Flare Network (which was  airdropped from holding XRP) via a token called DFLR (the DAO token for Flare  Finance). </p>

<ul><li>You will receive dFLR around a month after the first Spark airdrop. </li>
<li>When you receive your dFLR, you will have 7 days to swap this for yFLR in order to  begin utilizing the DeFi platform. You will be able to swap dFLR for yFLR on a 1:1 ratio</li>
<li>Any yFLR that is not claimed by the dFLR swap within 7 days will either be burnt or  added to a reserve pool (depending on governance proposal vote) </li>
<li>You will be able to purchase Spark tokens from exchanges to add to your current  airdropped stack, meaning you will be able to receive more dFLR </li>
<li>The only wallet or exchange currently supporting the dFLR airdrop is D'Cent Wallet </li>
<li>Bitrue and Poloniex are currently selling IOU Spark tokens. The terms of these are down  to the exchange and Flare Network has no participation in this </li>
</ul>

<h2>Tokens &amp; Products: </h2>

<p>There are six products:</p>

<ul><li>FlareX: Flare's decentralized exchange - like Uniswap </li>
<li>Flare Wrap: Bring ERC20 tokens onto the Flare Network </li>
<li>Flare Farm: Stake to earn yFIN and more project tokens </li>
<li>Flare Mine: Mine FLR through mining Bitcoin and Ethereum, with no extra power  requirements </li>
<li>Flare Loans: Decentralized loans. Provide currencies for people to receive loans. Or,  receive loans by providing collateral.</li>
<li>Flare Mutual: Decentralized insurance. Pool your assets to give people coverage over  smart contract hacks/bugs/failures. Or, receive coverage for smart contract  failures/bugs/hacks </li>
</ul>

<p>And four tokens: </p>

<ul><li>YieldFin (YFIN): One of the main Flare Finance tokens used for Governance of the  whole ecosystem and also, loans, mutual funds and farming </li>
<li>YieldFlare (YFLR): The secondary governance token, used for FlareX Governance and  also, the fee charge for FlareX swaps and liquidity rewards </li>
<li>FlareUSD (xUSD): The Flare Network stablecoin </li>
<li>YieldMine (YMIN): A token earnt alongside Flare via mining Bitcoin and Ethereum. Burn  this token whilst mining to earn more Flare.</li>
</ul>
