<h1>Religion</h1>
<p>"He who thinks half-heartedly will not believe in God; but he who really thinks has to believe in God." --Isaac Newton</p>
<p>"We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter." --Max Planck</p>
<p>"The book of nature which we have to read is written by the finger of God." --Michael Faraday</p>
<p>"The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you." --Werner Heisenberg</p>
<p>"The gift of mental power comes from God, Divine Being, and if we concentrate our minds on that truth, we become in tune with this great power." --Nikola Tesla</p>
<p>"I have looked into most philosophical systems and I have seen that none will work without God." --James Clerk Maxwell</p>
<p>"A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty." --Albert Einstein</p>

What happens if we assume we only are conscious one lifetime? Modern physics (LQG) replaces the big bang with a big bounce and since reality will never stop existing we can divide all time into infinitely many lifetime pieces. One of these pieces is then all our conscious experience. Next we draw one piece to represent the present moment, the odds of drawing the single piece where we are conscious is one in infinity, which is 0. However we know that we are conscious now so this probability cannot be 0, therefore our initial assumption must be false. By contradiction we have proven there is life after death.
