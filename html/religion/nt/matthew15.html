<h1>Matthew 15:1-39</h1>

<p>Mt 15:1-39</p>

<p>[1]Then Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said,</p>

<p>[1]Nuko Abafarisayo n'abanditsi bavuye i Yerusalemu baza aho Yesu ari baramubaza bati</p>

<p>[2]'Why do your disciples break away from the tradition of the elders? They eat without washing their hands.'</p>

<p>[2]“Ni iki gituma abigishwa bawe bataziririza imigenzo y'abakera, ntibajabike intoki mu mazi bagiye kurya?”</p>

<p>[3]He answered, 'And why do you break away from the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?</p>

<p>[3]Na we arababaza ati “Namwe ni iki gituma mucumurira itegeko ry'Imana imigenzo yanyu?</p>

<p>[4]For God said, "Honour your father and your mother" and "Anyone who curses his father or mother will be put to death."</p>

<p>[4]Kuko Imana yavuze iti ‘Wubahe so na nyoko', kandi iti ‘Ututse se cyangwa nyina bamwice.'</p>

<p>[5]But you say, "If anyone says to his father or mother: Anything I might have used to help you is dedicated to God,</p>

<p>[5]Ariko mwebweho muravuga muti ‘Umuntu wese ubwira se cyangwa nyina ati: Icyo najyaga kugufashisha nagituye Imana,umeze atyo ntahatwa kubaha se cyangwa nyina.'</p>

<p>[6]he is rid of his duty to father or mother." In this way you have made God's word ineffective by means of your tradition.</p>

<p>[6]Nuko ijambo ry'Imana mwarihinduye ubusa ngo mukomeze imigenzo yanyu.</p>

<p>[7]Hypocrites! How rightly Isaiah prophesied about you when he said:</p>

<p>[7]Mwa ndyarya mwe, Yesaya yahanuye ibyanyu neza ati</p>

<p>[8]This people honours me only with lip-service, while their hearts are far from me.</p>

<p>[8]‘Ubu bwoko bunshimisha iminwa,Ariko imitima yabo imba kure.</p>

<p>[9]Their reverence of me is worthless; the lessons they teach are nothing but human commandments.'</p>

<p>[9]Bansengera ubusa,Kuko inyigisho bigisha ari amategeko y'abantu.' ”</p>

<p>[10]He called the people to him and said, 'Listen, and understand.</p>

<p>[10]Ahamagara abantu arababwira ati “Nimwumve musobanukirwe.</p>

<p>[11]What goes into the mouth does not make anyone unclean; it is what comes out of the mouth that makes someone unclean.'</p>

<p>[11]Ikijya mu kanwa si cyo gihumanya umuntu, ahubwo ikiva mu kanwa ni cyo kimuhumanya.”</p>

<p>[12]Then the disciples came to him and said, 'Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked when they heard what you said?'</p>

<p>[12]Maze abigishwa baramwegera baramubaza bati “Uzi yuko Abafarisayo barakajwe no kumva ayo magambo?”</p>

<p>[13]He replied, 'Any plant my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.</p>

<p>[13]Arabasubiza ati “Igiti cyose Data wo mu ijuru adateye kizarandurwa.</p>

<p>[14]Leave them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind; and if one blind person leads another, both will fall into a pit.'</p>

<p>[14]Nimubareke ni abarandata impumyi kandi na bo bahumye. Ariko impumyi iyo irandase indi zombi zigwa mu mwobo.”</p>

<p>[15]At this, Peter said to him, 'Explain the parable for us.'</p>

<p>[15]Petero aramusubiza ati “Dusobanurire uwo mugani.”</p>

<p>[16]Jesus replied, 'Even you -- don't you yet understand?</p>

<p>[16]Aramubaza ati “Mbese namwe ntimurajijuka?</p>

<p>[17]Can't you see that whatever goes into the mouth passes through the stomach and is discharged into the sewer?</p>

<p>[17]Ntimuzi yuko ikintu cyose kigiye mu kanwa kijya mu nda kikanyura mu nzira yacyo?</p>

<p>[18]But whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and it is this that makes someone unclean.</p>

<p>[18]Ariko ibiva mu kanwa biba bivuye mu mutima, ni byo bihumanya umuntu.</p>

<p>[19]For from the heart come evil intentions: murder, adultery, fornication, theft, perjury, slander.</p>

<p>[19]Kuko mu mutima w'umuntu ari ho haturuka ibitekerezo bibi: kwica no gusambana no guheheta, kwiba no kubeshyera abandi n'ibitutsi.</p>

<p>[20]These are the things that make a person unclean. But eating with unwashed hands does not make anyone unclean.'</p>

<p>[20]Ibyo ni byo bihumanya umuntu, ariko kurisha intoki zitajabitse mu mazi ntiguhumanya umuntu.”</p>

<p>[21]Jesus left that place and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</p>

<p>[21]Yesu arahava ajya mu gihugu cy'i Tiro n'i Sidoni.</p>

<p>[22]And suddenly out came a Canaanite woman from that district and started shouting, 'Lord, Son of David, take pity on me. My daughter is tormented by a devil.'</p>

<p>[22]Umunyakanānikazi aturuka muri icyo gihugu arataka cyane ati “Mwami mwene Dawidi, mbabarira, umukobwa wanjye atewe na dayimoni cyane.”</p>

<p>[23]But he said not a word in answer to her. And his disciples went and pleaded with him, saying, 'Give her what she wants, because she keeps shouting after us.'</p>

<p>[23]Ntiyagira icyo amusubiza. Nuko abigishwa be baramwegera baramwinginga bati “Musezerere kuko adutakira inyuma.”</p>

<p>[24]He said in reply, 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of the House of Israel.'</p>

<p>[24]Arabasubiza ati “Sinatumiwe abandi, keretse intama zazimiye zo mu muryango wa Isirayeli.”</p>

<p>[25]But the woman had come up and was bowing low before him. 'Lord,' she said, 'help me.'</p>

<p>[25]Na we araza aramupfukamira aramubwira ati “Mwami, ntabara.”</p>

<p>[26]He replied, 'It is not fair to take the children's food and throw it to little dogs.'</p>

<p>[26]Aramusubiza ati “Si byiza kwenda ibyokurya by'abana ngo mbijugunyire imbwa.”</p>

<p>[27]She retorted, 'Ah yes, Lord; but even little dogs eat the scraps that fall from their masters' table.'</p>

<p>[27]Na we ati “Ni koko Mwami, ariko imbwa na zo zirya ubuvungukira bugwa buvuye ku meza ya ba nyirazo.”</p>

<p>[28]Then Jesus answered her, 'Woman, you have great faith. Let your desire be granted.' And from that moment her daughter was well again.</p>

<p>[28]Maze Yesu aramusubiza ati “Mugore, kwizera kwawe ni kwinshi, bikubere uko ushaka.” Umukobwa we aherako arakira.</p>

<p>[29]Jesus went on from there and reached the shores of the Lake of Galilee, and he went up onto the mountain. He took his seat,</p>

<p>[29]Yesu avayo ajya ku Nyanja y'i Galilaya, azamuka umusozi aricara.</p>

<p>[30]and large crowds came to him bringing the lame, the crippled, the blind, the dumb and many others; these they put down at his feet, and he cured them.</p>

<p>[30]Abantu benshi baza aho ari, bazana abacumbagira n'ibirema, n'impumyi n'ibiragi n'abandi barwayi benshi, babarambika hasi imbere ye arabakiza,</p>

<p>[31]The crowds were astonished to see the dumb speaking, the cripples whole again, the lame walking and the blind with their sight, and they praised the God of Israel.</p>

<p>[31]bituma abantu batangara babonye ibiragi bivuga, ibirema ari bizima, abacumbagira bagenda, n'impumyi zireba, bahimbaza Imana y'Abisirayeli.</p>

<p>[32]But Jesus called his disciples to him and said, 'I feel sorry for all these people; they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them off hungry, or they might collapse on the way.'</p>

<p>[32]Yesu ahamagara abigishwa be arababwira ati “Mbabariye abo bantu kuko uyu munsi ari uwa gatatu turi kumwe, none ntibafite ibyokurya. Sinshaka kubasezerera batariye, isari itabatsinda ku nzira.”</p>

<p>[33]The disciples said to him, 'Where in a deserted place could we get sufficient bread for such a large crowd to have enough to eat?'</p>

<p>[33]Abigishwa baramubaza bati “Muri ubu butayu twakura he imitsima ingana ityo yo guhaza abantu bangana batya?”</p>

<p>[34]Jesus said to them, 'How many loaves have you?' They said, 'Seven, and a few small fish.'</p>

<p>[34]Yesu na we arababaza ati “Mufite imitsima ingahe?”Baramusubiza bati “Ni irindwi n'udufi duke.”</p>

<p>[35]Then he instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground,</p>

<p>[35]Ategeka abantu ko bicara hasi.</p>

<p>[36]and he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks he broke them and began handing them to the disciples, who gave them to the crowds.</p>

<p>[36]Yenda iyo mitsima irindwi n'udufi, arabishimira, arabimanyagura, abiha abigishwa be, na bo babiha abantu.</p>

<p>[37]They all ate as much as they wanted, and they collected what was left of the scraps, seven baskets full.</p>

<p>[37]Bose bararya barahaga, bateranya ubuvungukira busigaye, bwuzura ibitebo birindwi.</p>

<p>[38]Now four thousand men had eaten, to say nothing of women and children.</p>

<p>[38]Abariye bari abagabo ibihumbi bine, abagore n'abana batabariwemo.</p>

<p>[39]And when he had sent the crowds away he got into the boat and went to the territory of Magadan.</p>

<p>[39]Asezerera abantu, yikira mu bwato ajya mu gihugu cy'i Magadani.
