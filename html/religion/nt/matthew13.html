<h1>Matthew 13:1-58</h1>

<p>Mt 13:1-58</p>

<p>[1]That same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeside,</p>

<p>[1]Uwo munsi Yesu asohoka mu nzu, yicara mu kibaya cy'inyanja.</p>

<p>[2]but such large crowds gathered round him that he got into a boat and sat there. The people all stood on the shore,</p>

<p>[2]Abantu benshi bateranira aho ari, bituma yikira mu bwato yicaramo, abantu bose bahagarara mu kibaya.</p>

<p>[3]and he told them many things in parables. He said, 'Listen, a sower went out to sow.</p>

<p>[3]Abigisha byinshi, abacira imigani aravuga ati“Umubibyi yasohoye imbuto.</p>

<p>[4]As he sowed, some seeds fell on the edge of the path, and the birds came and ate them up.</p>

<p>[4]Akibiba zimwe zigwa mu nzira, inyoni ziraza zirazitoragura.</p>

<p>[5]Others fell on patches of rock where they found little soil and sprang up at once, because there was no depth of earth;</p>

<p>[5]Izindi zigwa ku kāra kadafite ubutaka bwinshi, uwo mwanya ziramera kuko ubutaka atari burebure,</p>

<p>[6]but as soon as the sun came up they were scorched and, not having any roots, they withered away.</p>

<p>[6]izuba rivuye ziraraba, maze kuko zitari zifite imizi ziruma.</p>

<p>[7]Others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.</p>

<p>[7]Izindi zigwa mu mahwa, amahwa arāruka araziniga.</p>

<p>[8]Others fell on rich soil and produced their crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>

<p>[8]Izindi zigwa mu butaka bwiza zera imbuto, imwe ijana, indi mirongo itandatu, indi mirongo itatu, bityo bityo.</p>

<p>[9]Anyone who has ears should listen!'</p>

<p>[9]Ufite amatwi niyumve.”</p>

<p>[10]Then the disciples went up to him and asked, 'Why do you talk to them in parables?'</p>

<p>[10]Abigishwa baramwegera baramubaza bati “Ni iki gituma ubigishiriza mu migani?”</p>

<p>[11]In answer, he said, 'Because to you is granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not granted.</p>

<p>[11]Arabasubiza ati “Mwebweho mwahawe kumenya ubwiru bw'ubwami bwo mu ijuru ariko bo ntibabihawe,</p>

<p>[12]Anyone who has will be given more and will have more than enough; but anyone who has not will be deprived even of what he has.</p>

<p>[12]kuko ufite wese azahabwa kandi akarushirizwaho, ariko udafite wese azakwa n'icyo yari afite.</p>

<p>[13]The reason I talk to them in parables is that they look without seeing and listen without hearing or understanding.</p>

<p>[13]Igituma mbigishiriza mu migani ni iki: ‘Ni uko iyo barebye batitegereza, n'iyo bumvise batumva kandi ntibasobanukirwe.'</p>

<p>[14]So in their case what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah is being fulfilled: Listen and listen, but never understand! Look and look, but never perceive!</p>

<p>[14]Ndetse ibyo Yesaya yahanuye bibasohoyeho ngo‘Kumva muzumva, ariko ntimuzabisobanukirwa,Kureba muzareba, ariko ntimuzabibona.</p>

<p>[15]This people's heart has grown coarse, their ears dulled, they have shut their eyes tight to avoid using their eyes to see, their ears to hear, their heart to understand, changing their ways and being healed by me.</p>

<p>[15]Kuko umutima w'ubu bwoko ufite ibinure,Amatwi yabo akaba ari ibihurihuri,Amaso yabo bakayahumiriza,Ngo batarebesha amaso,Batumvisha amatwi,Batamenyesha umutima,Bagahindukira ngo mbakize.'</p>

<p>[16]'But blessed are your eyes because they see, your ears because they hear!</p>

<p>[16]“Ariko amaso yanyu arahirwa kuko abona, n'amatwi yanyu kuko yumva.</p>

<p>[17]In truth I tell you, many prophets and upright people longed to see what you see, and never saw it; to hear what you hear, and never heard it.</p>

<p>[17]Ndababwira ukuri, yuko abahanuzi benshi n'abakiranutsi bifuzaga kureba ibyo mureba ntibabibone, no kumva ibyo mwumva ntibabyumve.</p>

<p>[18]'So pay attention to the parable of the sower.</p>

<p>[18]“Nuko nimwumve umugani w'umubibyi.</p>

<p>[19]When anyone hears the word of the kingdom without understanding, the Evil One comes and carries off what was sown in his heart: this is the seed sown on the edge of the path.</p>

<p>[19]Uwumva wese ijambo ry'ubwami ntarimenye, Umubi araza agasahura ikibibwe mu mutima we. Uwo ni we usa n'izibibwe mu nzira.</p>

<p>[20]The seed sown on patches of rock is someone who hears the word and welcomes it at once with joy.</p>

<p>[20]Kandi usa n'izibibwe ku kāra, uwo ni we wumva ijambo, uwo mwanya akaryemera anezerewe,</p>

<p>[21]But such a person has no root deep down and does not last; should some trial come, or some persecution on account of the word, at once he falls away.</p>

<p>[21]ntagire imizi muri we, maze agakomera umwanya muto. Iyo habayeho amakuba cyangwa kurenganywa azira iryo jambo, uwo mwanya biramugusha.</p>

<p>[22]The seed sown in thorns is someone who hears the word, but the worry of the world and the lure of riches choke the word and so it produces nothing.</p>

<p>[22]Kandi usa n'izibibwe mu mahwa, uwo ni we wumva ijambo, maze amaganya y'iyi si n'ibihendo by'ubutunzi bikaniga iryo jambo ntiryere.</p>

<p>[23]And the seed sown in rich soil is someone who hears the word and understands it; this is the one who yields a harvest and produces now a hundredfold, now sixty, now thirty.'</p>

<p>[23]Kandi usa n'izibibwe mu butaka bwiza, uwo ni we wumva ijambo akarimenya, akera imbuto umwe ijana, undi mirongo itandatu, undi mirongo itatu.”</p>

<p>[24]He put another parable before them, 'The kingdom of Heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.</p>

<p>[24]Nuko abacira undi mugani aravuga ati “Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'umuntu wabibye imbuto nziza mu murima we,</p>

<p>[25]While everybody was asleep his enemy came, sowed darnel all among the wheat, and made off.</p>

<p>[25]nuko abantu basinziriye, umwanzi araza abiba urukungu mu masaka, aragenda.</p>

<p>[26]When the new wheat sprouted and ripened, then the darnel appeared as well.</p>

<p>[26]Nuko amaze kumera no kwera, urukungu na rwo ruraboneka.</p>

<p>[27]The owner's labourers went to him and said, "Sir, was it not good seed that you sowed in your field? If so, where does the darnel come from?"</p>

<p>[27]Abagaragu be baraza babaza umutware bati ‘Mutware, ntiwabibye imbuto nziza mu murima wawe? None urukungu rurimo rwavuye he?'</p>

<p>[28]He said to them, "Some enemy has done this." And the labourers said, "Do you want us to go and weed it out?"</p>

<p>[28]Ati ‘Umwanzi ni we wagize atyo.' Abagaragu be baramubaza bati ‘Noneho urashaka ko tugenda tukarurandura?'</p>

<p>[29]But he said, "No, because when you weed out the darnel you might pull up the wheat with it.</p>

<p>[29]Na we ati ‘Oya, ahari nimurandura urukungu murarurandurana n'amasaka,</p>

<p>[30]Let them both grow till the harvest; and at harvest time I shall say to the reapers: First collect the darnel and tie it in bundles to be burnt, then gather the wheat into my barn." '</p>

<p>[30]mureke bikurane byombi bigeze igihe cyo gusarurwa. Mu isarura nzabwira abasaruzi nti: Mubanze muteranye urukungu muruhambire imitwaro rutwikwe, maze amasaka muyahunike mu kigega cyanjye.' ”</p>

<p>[31]He put another parable before them, 'The kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.</p>

<p>[31]Abacira undi mugani ati “Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'akabuto ka sinapi, umuntu yenze akakabiba mu murima we.</p>

<p>[32]It is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the biggest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air can come and shelter in its branches.'</p>

<p>[32]Na ko ni gato hanyuma y'imbuto zose, nyamara iyo gakuze kaba kanini kakaruta imboga zose kakaba igiti, maze inyoni zo mu kirere zikaza zikarika ibyari mu mashami yacyo.”</p>

<p>[33]He told them another parable, 'The kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour till it was leavened all through.'</p>

<p>[33]Abacira undi mugani ati “Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'umusemburo umugore yenze, akawuhisha mu myariko itatu y'ifu kugeza aho iri busemburwe yose.”</p>

<p>[34]In all this Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; indeed, he would never speak to them except in parables.</p>

<p>[34]Ayo magambo yose Yesu ayigisha abantu mu migani, kandi nta cyo yabigishaga atabaciriye umugani,</p>

<p>[35]This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet: I will speak to you in parables, unfold what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.</p>

<p>[35]kugira ngo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi bisohore ngo“Nzabumbura akanwa kanjye nce imigani,Nzavuga amagambo yahishwe uhereye ku kuremwa kw'isi.”</p>

<p>[36]Then, leaving the crowds, he went to the house; and his disciples came to him and said, 'Explain to us the parable about the darnel in the field.'</p>

<p>[36]Maze asezera ku bantu yinjira mu nzu, abigishwa be baramwegera bati “Dusobanurire umugani w'urukungu rwo mu murima.”</p>

<p>[37]He said in reply, 'The sower of the good seed is the Son of man.</p>

<p>[37]Arabasubiza ati “Ubiba imbuto nziza ni Umwana w'umuntu,</p>

<p>[38]The field is the world; the good seed is the subjects of the kingdom; the darnel, the subjects of the Evil One;</p>

<p>[38]umurima ni isi, imbuto nziza ni zo bana b'ubwami, urukungu ni abana b'Umubi,</p>

<p>[39]the enemy who sowed it, the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; the reapers are the angels.</p>

<p>[39]umwanzi warubibye ni Umwanzi, isarura ni imperuka y'isi, abasaruzi ni abamarayika.</p>

<p>[40]Well then, just as the darnel is gathered up and burnt in the fire, so it will be at the end of time.</p>

<p>[40]Nk'uko urukungu rurandurwa rugatwikwa, ni ko bizaba ku mperuka y'isi.</p>

<p>[41]The Son of man will send his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of falling and all who do evil,</p>

<p>[41]Umwana w'umuntu azatuma abamarayika be, bateranye ibintu bigusha byose n'inkozi z'ibibi babikure mu bwami bwe,</p>

<p>[42]and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.</p>

<p>[42]babajugunye mu itanura ry'umuriro. Ni ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo.</p>

<p>[43]Then the upright will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Anyone who has ears should listen!</p>

<p>[43]Icyo gihe abakiranutsi bazarabagirana nk'izuba mu bwami bwa Se. Ufite amatwi niyumve.</p>

<p>[44]'The kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone has found; he hides it again, goes off in his joy, sells everything he owns and buys the field.</p>

<p>[44]“Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'izahabu zahishwe mu murima, umuntu azigwaho arazitwikīra aragenda, umunezero umutera kugura ibyo yari atunze byose ngo abone kugura uwo murima.</p>

<p>[45]'Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls;</p>

<p>[45]“Kandi ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'umutunzi ushaka imaragarita nziza,</p>

<p>[46]when he finds one of great value he goes and sells everything he owns and buys it.</p>

<p>[46]abonye imaragarita imwe y'igiciro cyinshi, aragenda agura ibyo yari atunze byose ngo abone kuyigura.</p>

<p>[47]'Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that is cast in the sea and brings in a haul of all kinds of fish.</p>

<p>[47]“Nuko kandi ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'urushundura bajugunya mu nyanja, ruroba ifi z'amoko yose.</p>

<p>[48]When it is full, the fishermen bring it ashore; then, sitting down, they collect the good ones in baskets and throw away those that are no use.</p>

<p>[48]Iyo rwuzuye barukururira ku nkombe, bakicara bagatoranyamo inziza bakazishyira mu mbehe, imbi bakazita.</p>

<p>[49]This is how it will be at the end of time: the angels will appear and separate the wicked from the upright,</p>

<p>[49]Uko ni ko bizaba ku mperuka y'isi: abamarayika bazasohoka batoranye abanyabyaha mu bakiranutsi,</p>

<p>[50]to throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.</p>

<p>[50]babajugunye mu itanura ry'umuriro, ni ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo.</p>

<p>[51]'Have you understood all these?' They said, 'Yes.'</p>

<p>[51]“Ayo magambo yose aho murayumvise?”Baramusubiza bati “Yee.”</p>

<p>[52]And he said to them, 'Well then, every scribe who becomes a disciple of the kingdom of Heaven is like a householder who brings out from his storeroom new things as well as old.'</p>

<p>[52]Arababwira ati “Ni cyo gitumye umwanditsi wese wigishijwe iby'ubwami bwo mu ijuru agereranywa na nyir'urugo utanga ibintu bishya n'ibya kera, abikuye mu bubiko bwe.”</p>

<p>[53]When Jesus had finished these parables he left the district;</p>

<p>[53]Yesu amaze kubacira iyo migani, avayo</p>

<p>[54]and, coming to his home town, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a way that they were astonished and said, 'Where did the man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?</p>

<p>[54]ajya mu gihugu cy'iwabo, aheraho yigishiriza mu masinagogi yabo, bituma batangara bati “Ubu bwenge n'ibi bitangaza uyu yabikuye he?</p>

<p>[55]This is the carpenter's son, surely? Is not his mother the woman called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Jude?</p>

<p>[55]Mbese harya si we wa mwana w'umubaji? Nyina ntiyitwa Mariya, na bene se si Yakobo na Yosefu na Simoni na Yuda?</p>

<p>[56]His sisters, too, are they not all here with us? So where did the man get it all?'</p>

<p>[56]Bashiki be na bo bose ntiduturanye? Mbese ibyo byose yabikuye he?”</p>

<p>[57]And they would not accept him. But Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is despised only in his own country and in his own house,'</p>

<p>[57]Ibye birabagusha.Yesu arababwira ati “Umuhanuzi ntabura icyubahiro, keretse mu gihugu cy'iwabo no mu nzu yabo.”</p>

<p>[58]and he did not work many miracles there because of their lack of faith.</p>

<p>[58]Aho Yesu ntiyakorerayo ibitangaza byinshi abitewe n'uko batamwizeye.
