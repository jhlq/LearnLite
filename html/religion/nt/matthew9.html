<h1>Matthew 9:1-37</h1>

<p>Mt 9:1-38</p>

<p>[1]He got back in the boat, crossed the water and came to his home town.</p>

<p>[1]Yikira mu bwato arambuka, agera mu mudugudu w'iwabo.</p>

<p>[2]And suddenly some people brought him a paralytic stretched out on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, 'Take comfort, my child, your sins are forgiven.'</p>

<p>[2]Bamuzanira ikirema kiryamye mu ngobyi, nuko Yesu abonye kwizera kwabo abwira icyo kirema ati “Mwana wanjye, humura ibyaha byawe urabibabariwe.”</p>

<p>[3]And now some scribes said to themselves, 'This man is being blasphemous.'</p>

<p>[3]Abanditsi bamwe baribwira bati “Uyu arigereranije.”</p>

<p>[4]Knowing what was in their minds Jesus said, 'Why do you have such wicked thoughts in your hearts?</p>

<p>[4]Ariko Yesu amenya ibyo bibwira arababaza ati “Ni iki kibateye kwibwira ibidatunganye mu mitima yanyu?</p>

<p>[5]Now, which of these is easier: to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?</p>

<p>[5]Icyoroshye ni ikihe? Ni ukuvuga nti ‘Ibyaha byawe urabibabariwe', cyangwa nti ‘Byuka ugende'?</p>

<p>[6]But to prove to you that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins,' -- then he said to the paralytic-'get up, pick up your bed and go off home.'</p>

<p>[6]Ariko mumenye yuko Umwana w'umuntu afite ubutware mu isi, bwo kubabarira abantu ibyaha.” Nuko abwira icyo kirema ati “Byuka wikorere ingobyi yawe utahe.”</p>

<p>[7]And the man got up and went home.</p>

<p>[7]Arabyuka aragenda, arataha.</p>

<p>[8]A feeling of awe came over the crowd when they saw this, and they praised God for having given such authority to human beings.</p>

<p>[8]Abantu babibonye baratangara, bahimbaza Imana yahaye abantu ubutware bungana butyo.</p>

<p>[9]As Jesus was walking on from there he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, 'Follow me.' And he got up and followed him.</p>

<p>[9]Yesu avayo, akigenda abona umuntu witwaga Matayo yicaye aho yakoresherezaga ikoro, aramubwira ati “Nkurikira.”Arahaguruka, aramukurikira.</p>

<p>[10]Now while he was at table in the house it happened that a number of tax collectors and sinners came to sit at the table with Jesus and his disciples.</p>

<p>[10]Hanyuma ubwo Yesu yari yicaye mu nzu bafungura, haza abakoresha b'ikoro benshi n'abanyabyaha, basangira na Yesu n'abigishwa be.</p>

<p>[11]When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, 'Why does your master eat with tax collectors and sinners?'</p>

<p>[11]Abafarisayo babibonye babaza abigishwa be bati “Ni iki gitumye umwigisha wanyu asangira n'abakoresha b'ikoro n'abanyabyaha?”</p>

<p>[12]When he heard this he replied, 'It is not the healthy who need the doctor, but the sick.</p>

<p>[12]Abyumvise arababwira ati “Abazima si bo bifuza umuvuzi, keretse abarwayi.</p>

<p>[13]Go and learn the meaning of the words: Mercy is what pleases me, not sacrifice. And indeed I came to call not the upright, but sinners.'</p>

<p>[13]Ariko nimugende, mwige uko iri jambo risobanurwa ngo ‘Icyo nkunda ni imbabazi, si ibitambo.' Sinazanywe no guhamagara abakiranuka, keretse abanyabyaha.”</p>

<p>[14]Then John's disciples came to him and said, 'Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?'</p>

<p>[14]Maze haza abigishwa ba Yohana baramubaza bati “Ni iki gituma twebwe n'Abafarisayo twiyiriza ubusa kenshi, nyamara abigishwa bawe ntibiyirize ubusa?”</p>

<p>[15]Jesus replied, 'Surely the bridegroom's attendants cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is still with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.</p>

<p>[15]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Abasangwa ntibabasha kugira agahinda bakiri kumwe n'umukwe, ariko iminsi izaza, ubwo umukwe azabavanwamo, ni bwo baziyiriza ubusa.</p>

<p>[16]No one puts a piece of unshrunken cloth onto an old cloak, because the patch pulls away from the cloak and the tear gets worse.</p>

<p>[16]“Nta wutera ikiremo cy'igitambaro gishya ku mwenda ushaje kuko icyo kiremo cyaca umwenda, umwenge ukarushaho kuba mugari.</p>

<p>[17]Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the skins burst, the wine runs out, and the skins are lost. No; they put new wine in fresh skins and both are preserved.'</p>

<p>[17]Kandi nta wusuka vino y'umutobe mu mifuka y'impu ishaje, uwagira atyo iyo mifuka yaturika, vino igasandara hasi imifuka ikononekara. Ahubwo vino y'umutobe isukwa mu mifuka mishya, byombi bikarama.”</p>

<p>[18]While he was speaking to them, suddenly one of the officials came up, who bowed low in front of him and said, 'My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her and her life will be saved.'</p>

<p>[18]Akibabwira ayo magambo, haza umutware aramupfukamira, aramubwira ati “Umukobwa wanjye amaze gupfa, ariko ngwino umurambikeho ikiganza cyawe arahembuka.”</p>

<p>[19]Jesus rose and, with his disciples, followed him.</p>

<p>[19]Yesu arahaguruka, amukurikirana n'abigishwa be.</p>

<p>[20]Then suddenly from behind him came a woman, who had been suffering from a haemorrhage for twelve years, and she touched the fringe of his cloak,</p>

<p>[20]Nuko hari umugore uri mu mugongo wari abimaranye imyaka cumi n'ibiri, amuturuka inyuma akora ku nshunda z'umwenda we,</p>

<p>[21]for she was thinking, 'If only I can touch his cloak I shall be saved.'</p>

<p>[21]kuko yibwiraga ati “Ninkora umwenda we gusa ndakira.”</p>

<p>[22]Jesus turned round and saw her; and he said to her, 'Courage, my daughter, your faith has saved you.' And from that moment the woman was saved.</p>

<p>[22]Yesu arahindukira amubonye aramubwira ati “Mwana wanjye, komera. Kwizera kwawe kuragukijije.” Umugore akira uwo mwanya.</p>

<p>[23]When Jesus reached the official's house and saw the flute-players, with the crowd making a commotion, he said,</p>

<p>[23]Yesu ageze mu muryango w'inzu y'uwo mutware, abona abavuza imyirongi n'abantu benshi baboroga</p>

<p>[24]'Get out of here; the little girl is not dead; she is asleep.' And they ridiculed him.</p>

<p>[24]arababwira ati “Nimuhave kuko agakobwa kadapfuye, ahubwo karasinziriye.” Baramuseka cyane.</p>

<p>[25]But when the people had been turned out he went inside and took her by the hand; and she stood up.</p>

<p>[25]Abantu bamaze guhezwa yinjira mu nzu, agafata ukuboko karabyuka.</p>

<p>[26]And the news of this spread all round the countryside.</p>

<p>[26]Iyo nkuru yamamara muri icyo gihugu cyose.</p>

<p>[27]As Jesus went on his way two blind men followed him shouting, 'Take pity on us, son of David.'</p>

<p>[27]Maze Yesu avayo. akigenda impumyi ebyiri ziramukurikira zitaka ziti “Tubabarire mwene Dawidi.”</p>

<p>[28]And when Jesus reached the house the blind men came up to him and he said to them, 'Do you believe I can do this?' They said, 'Lord, we do.'</p>

<p>[28]Ageze mu nzu izo mpumyi ziramwegera, Yesu arazibaza ati “Mwizeye ko mbishobora?”Ziramusubiza ziti “Yee, Databuja.”</p>

<p>[29]Then he touched their eyes saying, 'According to your faith, let it be done to you.'</p>

<p>[29]Aherako akora ku maso yazo arazibwira ati “Bibabere nk'uko mwizeye.”</p>

<p>[30]And their sight returned. Then Jesus sternly warned them, 'Take care that no one learns about this.'</p>

<p>[30]Amaso yabo arahumuka, Yesu arabihanangiriza cyane ati “Mwirinde ntihagire umuntu ubimenya.”</p>

<p>[31]But when they had gone away, they talked about him all over the countryside.</p>

<p>[31]Nyamara basohotse bamwamamaza hose muri icyo gihugu.</p>

<p>[32]They had only just left when suddenly a man was brought to him, a dumb demoniac.</p>

<p>[32]Bakigenda, bamuzanira ikiragi gitewe na dayimoni.</p>

<p>[33]And when the devil was driven out, the dumb man spoke and the people were amazed and said, 'Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.'</p>

<p>[33]Amaze kwirukana dayimoni ikiragi kiravuga, abantu baratangara bati “Uhereye kera kose ntihigeze kuboneka nk'ibi muri Isirayeli.”</p>

<p>[34]But the Pharisees said, 'It is through the prince of devils that he drives out devils.'</p>

<p>[34]Ariko Abafarisayo baravuga bati “Umutware w'abadayimoni ni we umuha kwirukana abadayimoni.”</p>

<p>[35]Jesus made a tour through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing all kinds of disease and all kinds of illness.</p>

<p>[35]Yesu agenda mu midugudu n'ibirorero byose, yigisha mu masinagogi avuga ubutumwa bwiza bw'ubwami, akiza indwara zose n'ubumuga bwose.</p>

<p>[36]And when he saw the crowds he felt sorry for them because they were harassed and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd.</p>

<p>[36]Abonye abantu uko ari benshi arabababarira, kuko bari barushye cyane basandaye nk'intama zitagira umwungeri.</p>

<p>[37]Then he said to his disciples, 'The harvest is rich but the labourers are few, </p>

<p>[37]Maze abwira abigishwa be ati “Ibisarurwa ni byinshi, ariko abasaruzi ni bake.</p>

<p>[38]so ask the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers to his harvest.'</p>

<p>[38]Nuko rero mwinginge nyir'ibisarurwa, yohereze abasaruzi mu bisarurwa bye.”
