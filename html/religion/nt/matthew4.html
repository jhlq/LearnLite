<h1>Matthew 4:1-25</h1>

<p>Mt 4:1-17,0,18-25</p>

<p>[1]Then Jesus was led by the Spirit out into the desert to be put to the test by the devil.</p>

<p>[1]Maze Yesu ajyanwa n'Umwuka mu butayu kugeragezwa n'umwanzi,</p>

<p>[2]He fasted for forty days and forty nights, after which he was hungry,</p>

<p>[2]amaze iminsi mirongo ine n'amajoro mirongo ine atarya, abona gusonza.</p>

<p>[3]and the tester came and said to him, 'If you are Son of God, tell these stones to turn into loaves.'</p>

<p>[3]Umushukanyi aramwegera aramubwira ati “Niba uri Umwana w'Imana, bwira aya mabuye ahinduke imitsima.”</p>

<p>[4]But he replied, 'Scripture says: Human beings live not on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'</p>

<p>[4]Aramusubiza ati “Handitswe ngo ‘Umuntu ntatungwa n'umutsima gusa, ahubwo atungwa n'amagambo yose ava mu kanwa k'Imana.' ”</p>

<p>[5]The devil then took him to the holy city and set him on the parapet of the Temple.</p>

<p>[5]Maze umwanzi amujyana ku murwa wera, amuhagarika ku gasongero k'urusengero</p>

<p>[6]'If you are Son of God,' he said, 'throw yourself down; for scripture says: He has given his angels orders about you, and they will carry you in their arms in case you trip over a stone.'</p>

<p>[6]aramubwira ati “Niba uri Umwana w'Imana, ijugunye hasi kuko handitswe ngo‘Izagutegekera abamarayika bayo,Bakuramire mu maboko yabo,Ngo udakubita ikirenge ku ibuye.' ”</p>

<p>[7]Jesus said to him, 'Scripture also says: Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'</p>

<p>[7]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Kandi handitswe ngo ‘Ntukagerageze Uwiteka Imana yawe.' ”</p>

<p>[8]Next, taking him to a very high mountain, the devil showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour.</p>

<p>[8]Umwanzi arongera amujyana mu mpinga y'umusozi muremure cyane, amwereka ubwami bwose bwo mu isi n'ubwiza bwabwo</p>

<p>[9]And he said to him, 'I will give you all these, if you fall at my feet and do me homage.'</p>

<p>[9]aramubwira ati “Biriya byose ndabiguha nupfukama ukandamya.”</p>

<p>[10]Then Jesus replied, 'Away with you, Satan! For scripture says: The Lord your God is the one to whom you must do homage, him alone you must serve.'</p>

<p>[10]Yesu aramubwira ati “Genda Satani, kuko handitswe ngo ‘Uramye Uwiteka Imana yawe, abe ari yo ukorera yonyine.' ”</p>

<p>[11]Then the devil left him, and suddenly angels appeared and looked after him.</p>

<p>[11]Umwanzi aherako aramureka, maze haza abamarayika baramukorera.</p>

<p>[12]Hearing that John had been arrested he withdrew to Galilee,</p>

<p>[12]Yesu yumvise ko babohesheje Yohana, aragenda ajya i Galilaya.</p>

<p>[13]and leaving Nazara he went and settled in Capernaum, beside the lake, on the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali.</p>

<p>[13]Yimuka i Nazareti atura i Kaperinawumu, umudugudu uri ku nyanja mu rugabano rwa Zebuluni na Nafutali,</p>

<p>[14]This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:</p>

<p>[14]ngo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yesaya bisohore ngo</p>

<p>[15]Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Way of the sea beyond Jordan. Galilee of the nations!</p>

<p>[15]“Mu gihugu cya Zebuluni na Nafutali,Hafi y'inyanja hakurya ya Yorodani,N'i Galilaya y'abapagani,</p>

<p>[16]The people that lived in darkness have seen a great light; on those who lived in a country of shadow dark as death a light has dawned.</p>

<p>[16]Abantu bari bicaye mu mwijima babonye umucyo mwinshi,kandi abari bicaye mu gihugu cy'urupfu no mu gicucu cyarwo,Bamurikirwa n'umucyo.”</p>

<p>[17]From then onwards Jesus began his proclamation with the message, 'Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is close at hand.'</p>

<p>[17]Yesu ahera ubwo atangira kwigisha avuga ati “Mwihane kuko ubwami bwo mu ijuru buri hafi.” [0](Mar 1.16-20; Luka 5.1-11; Yoh 1.35-42)</p>

<p>[18]As he was walking by the Lake of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter, and his brother Andrew; they were making a cast into the lake with their net, for they were fishermen.</p>

<p>[18]Agenda iruhande rw'inyanja y'i Galilaya abona abavandimwe babiri, Simoni witwaga Petero na Andereya mwene se, barobesha urushundura mu nyanja kuko bari abarobyi.</p>

<p>[19]And he said to them, 'Come after me and I will make you fishers of people.'</p>

<p>[19]Arababwira ati “Nimunkurikire nzabagire abarobyi b'abantu.”</p>

<p>[20]And at once they left their nets and followed him.</p>

<p>[20]Uwo mwanya basiga inshundura baramukurikira.</p>

<p>[21]Going on from there he saw another pair of brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John; they were in their boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.</p>

<p>[21]Yicumye imbere abona abandi bavandimwe babiri, umwe ni Yakobo mwene Zebedayo na Yohana mwene se, bari mu bwato hamwe na se Zebedayo bapfundikanya inshundura zabo, arabahamagara.</p>

<p>[22]And at once, leaving the boat and their father, they followed him.</p>

<p>[22]Uwo mwanya basiga ubwato na se, baramukurikira.</p>

<p>[23]He went round the whole of Galilee teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing all kinds of disease and illness among the people.</p>

<p>[23]Yesu agenderera ab'i Galilaya hose, abigishiriza mu masinagogi yabo ababwira ubutumwa bwiza bw'ubwami, akiza n'indwara zose n'ubumuga bw'abantu.</p>

<p>[24]His fame spread throughout Syria, and those who were suffering from diseases and painful complaints of one kind or another, the possessed, epileptics, the paralysed, were all brought to him, and he cured them.</p>

<p>[24]Inkuru ye yamamara i Siriya yose, bamuzanira abarwayi bose n'indembe barwaye indwara zitari zimwe, n'abatewe n'abadayimoni, n'abarwaye ibicuri n'ibirema arabakiza.</p>

<p>[25]Large crowds followed him, coming from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judaea and Transjordan.</p>

<p>[25]Abantu benshi baramukurikira bavuye i Galilaya n'i Dekapoli, n'i Yerusalemu n'i Yudaya no hakurya ya Yorodani.
