<h1>Matthew 24:1-51</h1>

<p>Mt 24:1-51</p>

<p>[1]Jesus left the Temple, and as he was going away his disciples came up to draw his attention to the Temple buildings.</p>

<p>[1]Yesu asohoka mu rusengero. Akigenda, abigishwa be baramusanga bashaka kumwereka imyubakire y'urusengero.</p>

<p>[2]He said to them in reply, 'You see all these? In truth I tell you, not a single stone here will be left on another: everything will be pulled down.'</p>

<p>[2]Arababwira ati “Ntimureba ibi byose? Ndababwira ukuri yuko aha hatazasigara ibuye rigeretse ku rindi ritajugunywe hasi.”</p>

<p>[3]And while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives the disciples came and asked him when they were by themselves, 'Tell us, when is this going to happen, and what sign will there be of your coming and of the end of the world?'</p>

<p>[3]Yicaye ku musozi wa Elayono, abigishwa baza aho ari biherereye baramubaza bati “Tubwire, ibyo bizaba ryari, n'ikimenyetso cyo kuza kwawe n'icy'imperuka y'isi ni ikihe?”</p>

<p>[4]And Jesus answered them, 'Take care that no one deceives you,</p>

<p>[4]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Mwirinde hatagira umuntu ubayobya,</p>

<p>[5]because many will come using my name and saying, "I am the Christ," and they will deceive many.</p>

<p>[5]kuko benshi bazaza biyita izina ryanjye bati ‘Ni jye Kristo', bazayobya benshi.</p>

<p>[6]You will hear of wars and rumours of wars; see that you are not alarmed, for this is something that must happen, but the end will not be yet.</p>

<p>[6]Muzumva iby'intambara n'impuha z'intambara, mwirinde mudahagarika imitima kuko bitazabura kubaho, ariko imperuka izaba itaraza.</p>

<p>[7]For nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</p>

<p>[7]Ishyanga rizatera irindi shyanga, n'ubwami buzatera ubundi bwami, hazabaho inzara n'ibishyitsi hamwe na hamwe.</p>

<p>[8]All this is only the beginning of the birthpangs.</p>

<p>[8]Ariko ibyo byose bizaba ari itangiriro ryo kuramukwa.</p>

<p>[9]'Then you will be handed over to be tortured and put to death; and you will be hated by all nations on account of my name.</p>

<p>[9]“Ubwo ni bwo bazabagambanira ngo mubabazwe, ndetse bazabica, muzangwa n'amahanga yose abahora izina ryanjye.</p>

<p>[10]And then many will fall away; people will betray one another and hate one another.</p>

<p>[10]Ni bwo benshi bazasubira inyuma, bazagambanirana bangane.</p>

<p>[11]Many false prophets will arise; they will deceive many,</p>

<p>[11]N'abahanuzi benshi b'ibinyoma bazaduka bayobye benshi.</p>

<p>[12]and with the increase of lawlessness, love in most people will grow cold;</p>

<p>[12]Maze kuko ubugome buzagwira, urukundo rwa benshi ruzakonja.</p>

<p>[13]but anyone who stands firm to the end will be saved.</p>

<p>[13]Ariko uwihangana akageza imperuka ni we uzakizwa.</p>

<p>[14]'This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed to the whole world as evidence to the nations. And then the end will come.</p>

<p>[14]Kandi ubu butumwa bwiza bw'ubwami buzigishwa mu isi yose, ngo bube ubuhamya bwo guhamiriza amahanga yose, ni bwo imperuka izaherako ize.</p>

<p>[15]'So when you see the appalling abomination, of which the prophet Daniel spoke, set up in the holy place (let the reader understand),</p>

<p>[15]“Ariko ubwo muzabona ikizira kirimbura cyahanuwe n'umuhanuzi Daniyeli gihagaze Ahera, (ubisoma abyitondere),</p>

<p>[16]then those in Judaea must escape to the mountains;</p>

<p>[16]icyo gihe abazaba bari i Yudaya bazahungire ku misozi,</p>

<p>[17]if anyone is on the housetop, he must not come down to collect his belongings from the house;</p>

<p>[17]n'uzaba ari hejuru y'inzu ye ntazamanuka ngo atware ku bintu byo mu nzu ye,</p>

<p>[18]if anyone is in the fields, he must not turn back to fetch his cloak.</p>

<p>[18]n'uzaba ari mu mirima ye ntazasubira imuhira ngo azane umwenda we.</p>

<p>[19]Alas for those with child, or with babies at the breast, when those days come!</p>

<p>[19]Abazaba batwite n'abonsa muri iyo minsi bazabona ishyano.</p>

<p>[20]Pray that you will not have to make your escape in winter or on a Sabbath.</p>

<p>[20]Namwe musengere kugira ngo guhunga kwanyu kutazabaho mu mezi y'imbeho cyangwa ku isabato,</p>

<p>[21]For then there will be great distress, unparalleled since the world began, and such as will never be again.</p>

<p>[21]kuko muri iyo minsi hazabaho umubabaro mwinshi, utigeze kubaho uhereye ku kuremwa ku isi ukageza none, kandi ntuzongera kubaho.</p>

<p>[22]And if that time had not been shortened, no human being would have survived; but shortened that time shall be, for the sake of those who are chosen.</p>

<p>[22]Iyo minsi iyaba itagabanijweho ntihajyaga kuzarokoka n'umwe, ariko ku bw'intore iyo minsi izagabanywaho.</p>

<p>[23]'If anyone says to you then, "Look, here is the Christ," or "Over here," do not believe it;</p>

<p>[23]“Icyo gihe umuntu nababwira ati ‘Dore Kristo ari hano', n'undi ati ‘Ari hano', ntimuzabyemere.</p>

<p>[24]for false Christs and false prophets will arise and provide great signs and portents, enough to deceive even the elect, if that were possible.</p>

<p>[24]Kuko abiyita Kristo n'abahanuzi b'ibinyoma bazaduka bakora ibimenyetso bikomeye n'ibitangaza, kugira ngo babone uko bayobya n'intore niba bishoboka.</p>

<p>[25]Look! I have given you warning.</p>

<p>[25]Dore mbibabwiye bitaraba.</p>

<p>[26]'If, then, they say to you, "Look, he is in the desert," do not go there; "Look, he is in some hiding place," do not believe it;</p>

<p>[26]“Nuko nibababwira bati ‘Dore ari mu butayu', ntimuzajyeyo, cyangwa bati ‘Dore ari mu kirambi', ntimuzabyemere.</p>

<p>[27]because the coming of the Son of man will be like lightning striking in the east and flashing far into the west.</p>

<p>[27]Kuko nk'uko umurabyo urabiriza iburasirazuba ukabonekera aho rirengera, ni ko no kuza k'Umwana w'umuntu kuzaba.</p>

<p>[28]Wherever the corpse is, that is where the vultures will gather.</p>

<p>[28]“Aho intumbi iri hose, ni ho inkongoro ziteranira.</p>

<p>[29]'Immediately after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</p>

<p>[29]“Ariko hanyuma y'umubabaro wo muri iyo minsi, uwo mwanya ‘Izuba rizijima, n'ukwezi ntikuzava umwezi wako, n'inyenyeri zizagwa ziva mu ijuru, n'imbaraga zo mu ijuru zizanyeganyega.'</p>

<p>[30]And then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven; then, too, all the peoples of the earth will beat their breasts; and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</p>

<p>[30]Ubwo ni bwo ikimenyetso cy'Umwana w'umuntu kizabonekera mu ijuru, n'amoko yose yo mu isi ni bwo azaboroga abonye Umwana w'umuntu aje ku bicu byo mu ijuru, afite ubushobozi n'ubwiza bwinshi.</p>

<p>[31]And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet to gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p>

<p>[31]Azatumisha abamarayika be ijwi rirenga ry'impanda, bateranye intore ze mu birere bine, uhereye impera y'ijuru ukageza iyindi mpera yaryo.</p>

<p>[32]'Take the fig tree as a parable: as soon as its twigs grow supple and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.</p>

<p>[32]“Murebere ku mutini ni wo cyitegererezo: ishami ryawo, iyo ritoshye ibibabi bikamera, mumenya yuko igihe cy'impeshyi kiri bugufi.</p>

<p>[33]So with you when you see all these things: know that he is near, right at the gates.</p>

<p>[33]Nuko namwe nimubona ibyo byose, muzamenye yuko ari hafi, ndetse ageze ku rugi.</p>

<p>[34]In truth I tell you, before this generation has passed away, all these things will have taken place.</p>

<p>[34]Ndababwira ukuri yuko ab'ubu bwoko batazashiraho kugeza aho ibyo byose bizasohorera.</p>

<p>[35]Sky and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</p>

<p>[35]Ijuru n'isi bizashira, ariko amagambo yanjye ntazashira na hato.</p>

<p>[36]But as for that day and hour, nobody knows it, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, no one but the Father alone.</p>

<p>[36]“Ariko uwo munsi n'icyo gihe nta wubizi, naho baba abamarayika bo mu ijuru cyangwa Umwana, keretse Data wenyine.</p>

<p>[37]'As it was in Noah's day, so will it be when the Son of man comes.</p>

<p>[37]Uko iminsi ya Nowa yari iri, no kuza k'Umwana w'umuntu ni ko kuzaba,</p>

<p>[38]For in those days before the Flood people were eating, drinking, taking wives, taking husbands, right up to the day Noah went into the ark,</p>

<p>[38]kuko nk'uko bari bameze muri iyo minsi yabanjirije umwuzure, bararyaga, baranywaga, bararongoraga, barashyingiraga, bageza umunsi Nowa yinjiriye mu nkuge,</p>

<p>[39]and they suspected nothing till the Flood came and swept them all away. This is what it will be like when the Son of man comes.</p>

<p>[39]ntibabimenya kugeza aho umwuzure waziye ukabatwara bose. Ni ko no kuza k'Umwana w'umuntu kuzaba.</p>

<p>[40]Then of two men in the fields, one is taken, one left;</p>

<p>[40]Icyo gihe abagabo babiri bazaba bari mu murima, umwe azajyanwa undi asigare,</p>

<p>[41]of two women grinding at the mill, one is taken, one left.</p>

<p>[41]abagore babiri bazaba basya ku rusyo, umwe azajyanwa undi asigare.</p>

<p>[42]'So stay awake, because you do not know the day when your master is coming.</p>

<p>[42]“Nuko mube maso kuko mutazi umunsi Umwami wanyu azazaho.</p>

<p>[43]You may be quite sure of this, that if the householder had known at what time of the night the burglar would come, he would have stayed awake and would not have allowed anyone to break through the wall of his house.</p>

<p>[43]Ariko ibi mubimenye, iyaba nyir'urugo yari amenye igicuku umujura azaziramo yabaye maso, ntiyamukundiye gucukura inzu ye.</p>

<p>[44]Therefore, you too must stand ready because the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.</p>

<p>[44]Nuko namwe mwitegure, kuko igihe mudatekereza ari cyo Umwana w'umuntu azaziramo.</p>

<p>[45]'Who, then, is the wise and trustworthy servant whom the master placed over his household to give them their food at the proper time?</p>

<p>[45]“Mbese ni nde mugaragu ukiranuka w'ubwenge, shebuja yasigiye abo mu rugo rwe kubagerera igerero igihe cyaryo?</p>

<p>[46]Blessed that servant if his master's arrival finds him doing exactly that.</p>

<p>[46]Uwo mugaragu arahirwa, shebuja naza agasanga abikora.</p>

<p>[47]In truth I tell you, he will put him in charge of everything he owns.</p>

<p>[47]Ndababwira ukuri yuko azamwegurira ibintu bye byose.</p>

<p>[48]But if the servant is dishonest and says to himself, "My master is taking his time,"</p>

<p>[48]Ariko umugaragu mubi niyibwira mu mutima we ati ‘Databuja aratinze',</p>

<p>[49]and sets about beating his fellow-servants and eating and drinking with drunkards,</p>

<p>[49]maze agatangira gukubita abagaragu bagenzi be no gusangira n'abasinzi,</p>

<p>[50]his master will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know.</p>

<p>[50]shebuja w'uwo mugaragu azaza umunsi atamutegereje n'igihe atazi,</p>

<p>[51]The master will cut him off and send him to the same fate as the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.'</p>

<p>[51]amucemo kabiri amuhanane n'indyarya. Ni ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo.
