<h1>Matthew 5:1-48</h1>

<p>Mt 5:1-48</p>

<p>[1]Seeing the crowds, he went onto the mountain. And when he was seated his disciples came to him.</p>

<p>[1]Abonye abantu benshi azamuka umusozi, maze kwicara abigishwa be baramwegera.</p>

<p>[2]Then he began to speak. This is what he taught them:</p>

<p>[2]Aterura amagambo ati</p>

<p>[3]How blessed are the poor in spirit: the kingdom of Heaven is theirs.</p>

<p>[3]“Hahirwa abakene mu mitima yabo,Kuko ubwami bwo mu ijuru ari ubwabo.</p>

<p>[4]Blessed are the gentle: they shall have the earth as inheritance.</p>

<p>[4]Hahirwa abashavura,Kuko ari bo bazahozwa.</p>

<p>[5]Blessed are those who mourn: they shall be comforted.</p>

<p>[5]Hahirwa abagwa neza,Kuko ari bo bazahabwa isi.</p>

<p>[6]Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for uprightness: they shall have their fill.</p>

<p>[6]Hahirwa abafite inzara n'inyota byo gukiranuka,Kuko ari bo bazahazwa.</p>

<p>[7]Blessed are the merciful: they shall have mercy shown them.</p>

<p>[7]Hahirwa abanyambabazi,Kuko ari bo bazazigirirwa.</p>

<p>[8]Blessed are the pure in heart: they shall see God.</p>

<p>[8]Hahirwa ab'imitima iboneye,Kuko ari bo bazabona Imana.</p>

<p>[9]Blessed are the peacemakers: they shall be recognised as children of God.</p>

<p>[9]Hahirwa abakiranura,Kuko ari bo bazitwa abana b'Imana.</p>

<p>[10]Blessed are those who are persecuted in the cause of uprightness: the kingdom of Heaven is theirs.</p>

<p>[10]Hahirwa abarenganyirijwe gukiranuka,Kuko ubwami bwo mu ijuru ari ubwabo.</p>

<p>[11]'Blessed are you when people abuse you and persecute you and speak all kinds of calumny against you falsely on my account.</p>

<p>[11]“Namwe muzahirwa ubwo bazabatuka bakabarenganya, bakababeshyera ibibi byinshi babampora.</p>

<p>[12]Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven; this is how they persecuted the prophets before you.</p>

<p>[12]Muzanezerwe, muzishime cyane kuko ingororano zanyu ari nyinshi mu ijuru, kuko ari ko barenganyije abahanuzi ba mbere.</p>

<p>[13]'You are salt for the earth. But if salt loses its taste, what can make it salty again? It is good for nothing, and can only be thrown out to be trampled under people's feet.</p>

<p>[13]“Muri umunyu w'isi. Mbese umunyu nukayuka uzaryoshywa n'iki? Nta cyo uba ukimaze keretse kujugunywa hanze, abantu bakawukandagira.</p>

<p>[14]'You are light for the world. A city built on a hill-top cannot be hidden.</p>

<p>[14]“Muri umucyo w'isi. Umudugudu wubatswe ku mpinga y'umusozi ntubasha kwihisha.</p>

<p>[15]No one lights a lamp to put it under a tub; they put it on the lamp-stand where it shines for everyone in the house.</p>

<p>[15]Nta bakongeza itabaza ngo baritwikirize intonga, ahubwo barishyira ku gitereko cyaryo rikamurikira abari mu nzu bose.</p>

<p>[16]In the same way your light must shine in people's sight, so that, seeing your good works, they may give praise to your Father in heaven.</p>

<p>[16]Abe ari ko umucyo wanyu ubonekera imbere y'abantu, kugira ngo babone imirimo yanyu myiza, bahereko bahimbaze So wo mu ijuru.</p>

<p>[17]'Do not imagine that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have come not to abolish but to complete them.</p>

<p>[17]“Mwitekereza ko naje gukuraho amategeko cyangwa ibyahanuwe. Sinaje kubikuraho, ahubwo naje kubisohoza.</p>

<p>[18]In truth I tell you, till heaven and earth disappear, not one dot, not one little stroke, is to disappear from the Law until all its purpose is achieved.</p>

<p>[18]Kandi ndababwira ukuri yuko ijuru n'isi kugeza aho bizashirira, amategeko atazavaho inyuguti imwe cyangwa agace kayo gato, kugeza aho byose bizarangirira.</p>

<p>[19]Therefore, anyone who infringes even one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be considered the least in the kingdom of Heaven; but the person who keeps them and teaches them will be considered great in the kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>[19]Nuko uzica rimwe ryo muri ayo mategeko naho ryaba ryoroshye hanyuma y'ayandi, akigisha abandi kugira batyo, mu bwami bwo mu ijuru azitwa mutoya rwose. Ariko uzayakora akayigisha abandi, mu bwami bwo mu ijuru azitwa mukuru.</p>

<p>[20]'For I tell you, if your uprightness does not surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>[20]Kandi ndababwira yuko gukiranuka kwanyu nikutaruta ukw'abanditsi n'ukw'Abafarisayo, mutazinjira mu bwami bwo mu ijuru.</p>

<p>[21]'You have heard how it was said to our ancestors, You shall not kill; and if anyone does kill he must answer for it before the court.</p>

<p>[21]“Mwumvise ko abakera babwiwe ngo ‘Ntukice, uwica akwiriye guhanwa n'abacamanza.'</p>

<p>[22]But I say this to you, anyone who is angry with a brother will answer for it before the court; anyone who calls a brother "Fool" will answer for it before the Sanhedrin; and anyone who calls him "Traitor" will answer for it in hell fire.</p>

<p>[22]Ariko jyeweho ndababwira yuko umuntu wese urakarira mwene se akwiriye guhanwa n'abacamanza, uzatuka mwene se ati ‘Wa mupfu we', akwiriye guhanirwa mu rukiko, uzabwira mwene se ati ‘Wa gicucu we', akwiriye gushyirwa mu muriro w'i Gehinomu.</p>

<p>[23]So then, if you are bringing your offering to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</p>

<p>[23]Nuko nujyana ituro ryawe ku gicaniro, ukahibukira mwene so ko afite icyo mupfa,</p>

<p>[24]leave your offering there before the altar, go and be reconciled with your brother first, and then come back and present your offering.</p>

<p>[24]usige ituro ryawe imbere y'igicaniro ubanze ugende wikiranure na mwene so, uhereko ugaruke uture ituro ryawe.</p>

<p>[25]Come to terms with your opponent in good time while you are still on the way to the court with him, or he may hand you over to the judge and the judge to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison.</p>

<p>[25]“Wikiranure vuba n'ukurega mukiri mu nzira, ukurega ye kugushyikiriza umucamanza, umucamanza ataguha umusirikare akagushyira mu nzu y'imbohe.</p>

<p>[26]In truth I tell you, you will not get out till you have paid the last penny.</p>

<p>[26]Ndakubwira ukuri yuko utazavamo rwose, keretse wishyuye umwenda wose hadasigaye ikuta na rimwe.</p>

<p>[27]'You have heard how it was said, You shall not commit adultery.</p>

<p>[27]“Mwumvise ko byavuzwe ngo ‘Ntugasambane.'</p>

<p>[28]But I say this to you, if a man looks at a woman lustfully, he has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</p>

<p>[28]Jyeweho ndababwira yuko umuntu wese ureba umugore akamwifuza, aba amaze gusambana na we mu mutima we.</p>

<p>[29]If your right eye should be your downfall, tear it out and throw it away; for it will do you less harm to lose one part of yourself than to have your whole body thrown into hell.</p>

<p>[29]Ijisho ryawe ry'iburyo nirigushuka rikakugusha, urinogore urite kure. Ibyiza ni uko wapfa ijisho rimwe, biruta ko umubiri wawe wose wajugunywa muri Gehinomu.</p>

<p>[30]And if your right hand should be your downfall, cut it off and throw it away; for it will do you less harm to lose one part of yourself than to have your whole body go to hell.</p>

<p>[30]N'ikiganza cyawe cy'iburyo nikikugusha, ugice ugite kure. Ibyiza ni uko wabura urugingo rwawe rumwe, biruta ko umubiri wawe wose wajugunywa muri Gehinomu.</p>

<p>[31]'It has also been said, Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a writ of dismissal.</p>

<p>[31]“Kandi byaravuzwe ngo ‘Uzasenda umugore we, amuhe urwandiko rwo kumusenda.'</p>

<p>[32]But I say this to you, everyone who divorces his wife, except for the case of an illicit marriage, makes her an adulteress; and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</p>

<p>[32]Ariko jyeweho ndababwira yuko umuntu wese usenda umugore we atamuhora gusambana, aba amuteye gusambana, kandi uzacyura uwasenzwe azaba asambanye.</p>

<p>[33]'Again, you have heard how it was said to our ancestors, You must not break your oath, but must fulfil your oaths to the Lord.</p>

<p>[33]“Kandi mwumvise ko abakera babwiwe ngo ‘Ntukarahire ibinyoma, ahubwo uzakorere Umwami Imana ibyo wayirahiye.'</p>

<p>[34]But I say this to you, do not swear at all, either by heaven, since that is God's throne;</p>

<p>[34]Ariko jyeweho ndababwira kutarahira rwose, naho ryaba ijuru kuko ari ryo ntebe y'Imana,</p>

<p>[35]or by earth, since that is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, since that is the city of the great King.</p>

<p>[35]cyangwa isi kuko ari yo ntebe y'ibirenge byayo, cyangwa i Yerusalemu kuko ari ururembo rw'Umwami ukomeye.</p>

<p>[36]Do not swear by your own head either, since you cannot turn a single hair white or black.</p>

<p>[36]Kandi ntuzarahire umutwe wawe, kuko utabasha kweza agasatsi kamwe cyangwa ngo ukīrabuze.</p>

<p>[37]All you need say is "Yes" if you mean yes, "No" if you mean no; anything more than this comes from the Evil One.</p>

<p>[37]Ahubwo ijambo ryanyu ribe ‘Yee, Yee', ‘Oya, Oya', ibirenze ibyo bituruka ku Mubi.</p>

<p>[38]'You have heard how it was said: Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.</p>

<p>[38]“Mwumvise ko byavuzwe ngo ‘Ijisho rihōrerwe irindi, n'iryinyo rihōrerwe irindi.'</p>

<p>[39]But I say this to you: offer no resistance to the wicked. On the contrary, if anyone hits you on the right cheek, offer him the other as well;</p>

<p>[39]Ariko jyeweho ndababwira kutabuza umuntu mubi kubagirira nabi: ugukubise urushyi mu musaya w'iburyo, umuhindurire n'uw'ibumoso,</p>

<p>[40]if someone wishes to go to law with you to get your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.</p>

<p>[40]umuntu nashaka kukuburanya ngo agutware ikanzu yawe, umuhe n'umwitero,</p>

<p>[41]And if anyone requires you to go one mile, go two miles with him.</p>

<p>[41]ugutegetse kujyana na we mu gikingi kimwe, umujyane no mu cya kabiri.</p>

<p>[42]Give to anyone who asks you, and if anyone wants to borrow, do not turn away.</p>

<p>[42]Ukwaka umuhe kandi ushaka kugutira ntumwerekeze umugongo.</p>

<p>[43]'You have heard how it was said, You will love your neighbour and hate your enemy.</p>

<p>[43]“Mwumvise ko byavuzwe ngo ‘Ukunde mugenzi wawe, wange umwanzi wawe.'</p>

<p>[44]But I say this to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you;</p>

<p>[44]Ariko jyeweho ndababwira nti ‘Mukunde abanzi banyu, musabire ababarenganya,</p>

<p>[45]so that you may be children of your Father in heaven, for he causes his sun to rise on the bad as well as the good, and sends down rain to fall on the upright and the wicked alike.</p>

<p>[45]ni bwo muzaba abana ba So wo mu ijuru, kuko ategeka izuba rye kurasira ababi n'abeza, kandi abakiranuka n'abakiranirwa abavubira imvura.</p>

<p>[46]For if you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Do not even the tax collectors do as much?</p>

<p>[46]Nimukunda ababakunda gusa, muzahembwa iki? Mbese abakoresha ikoro na bo ntibagira batyo?</p>

<p>[47]And if you save your greetings for your brothers, are you doing anything exceptional?</p>

<p>[47]Nimuramutsa bene wanyu bonyine, abandi mubarusha iki? Mbese abapagani na bo ntibagira batyo?</p>

<p>[48]Do not even the gentiles do as much? You must therefore be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.'</p>

<p>[48]Namwe mube mukiranutse nk'uko So wo mu ijuru akiranuka.
