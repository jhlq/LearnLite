<h1>Matthew 25:1-46</h1>

<p>Mt 25:1-46</p>

<p>[1]'Then the kingdom of Heaven will be like this: Ten wedding attendants took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.</p>

<p>[1]“Icyo gihe ubwami bwo mu ijuru buzagereranywa n'abakobwa cumi bajyanye amatabaza yabo, bajya gusanganira umukwe.</p>

<p>[2]Five of them were foolish and five were sensible:</p>

<p>[2]Ariko muri abo cumi, abatanu bari abapfu, abandi batanu bari abanyabwenge.</p>

<p>[3]the foolish ones, though they took their lamps, took no oil with them,</p>

<p>[3]Abapfu bajyanye amatabaza yabo ntibajyana n'amavuta,</p>

<p>[4]whereas the sensible ones took flasks of oil as well as their lamps.</p>

<p>[4]ariko abanyabwenge bo bajyana amavuta mu mperezo zabo hamwe n'amatabaza yabo.</p>

<p>[5]The bridegroom was late, and they all grew drowsy and fell asleep.</p>

<p>[5]Umukwe atinze bose barahunikira, barasinzira.</p>

<p>[6]But at midnight there was a cry, "Look! The bridegroom! Go out and meet him."</p>

<p>[6]“Ariko nijoro mu gicuku habaho urusaku ngo ‘Umukwe araje, nimusohoke mumusanganire!'</p>

<p>[7]Then all those wedding attendants woke up and trimmed their lamps,</p>

<p>[7]Maze ba bakobwa bose barahaguruka baboneza amatabaza yabo.</p>

<p>[8]and the foolish ones said to the sensible ones, "Give us some of your oil: our lamps are going out."</p>

<p>[8]Abapfu babwira abanyabwenge bati ‘Nimuduhe ku mavuta yanyu, kuko amatabaza yacu azima.'</p>

<p>[9]But they replied, "There may not be enough for us and for you; you had better go to those who sell it and buy some for yourselves."</p>

<p>[9]Ariko abanyabwenge barabahakanira bati ‘Oya, ntiyadukwira twese, ahubwo nimujye mu bahanjuzi muyigurire.'</p>

<p>[10]They had gone off to buy it when the bridegroom arrived. Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding hall and the door was closed.</p>

<p>[10]Bagiye kugura, umukwe araza, abari biteguye binjirana na we mu bukwe, urugi rurakingwa.</p>

<p>[11]The other attendants arrived later. "Lord, Lord," they said, "open the door for us."</p>

<p>[11]“Hanyuma ba bakobwa bandi na bo baraza, barahamagara bati ‘Nyakubahwa, dukingurire.'</p>

<p>[12]But he replied, "In truth I tell you, I do not know you."</p>

<p>[12]Na we arabasubiza ati ‘Ndababwira ukuri yuko ntabazi.'</p>

<p>[13]So stay awake, because you do not know either the day or the hour.</p>

<p>[13]“Nuko mube maso, kuko mutazi umunsi cyangwa igihe.</p>

<p>[14]'It is like a man about to go abroad who summoned his servants and entrusted his property to them.</p>

<p>[14]“Bizaba nk'iby'umuntu wari ugiye kuzindukira mu kindi gihugu, ahamagara abagaragu be abasigira ibintu bye,</p>

<p>[15]To one he gave five talents, to another two, to a third one, each in proportion to his ability. Then he set out on his journey.</p>

<p>[15]aha umwe italanto eshanu, undi amuha ebyiri, undi amuha imwe uko umuntu ashoboye, arazinduka.</p>

<p>[16]The man who had received the five talents promptly went and traded with them and made five more.</p>

<p>[16]Uwo mwanya uwahawe italanto eshanu aragenda arazigenza, agenzuramo izindi talanto eshanu.</p>

<p>[17]The man who had received two made two more in the same way.</p>

<p>[17]N'uwahawe ebyiri abigenza atyo, agenzuramo izindi ebyiri.</p>

<p>[18]But the man who had received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.</p>

<p>[18]Ariko uwahawe imwe aragenda acukura umwobo, ahishamo italanto ya shebuja.</p>

<p>[19]Now a long time afterwards, the master of those servants came back and went through his accounts with them.</p>

<p>[19]“Maze iminsi myinshi ishize, shebuja w'abo bagaragu araza, abarana na bo umubare w'ibyo yabasigiye.</p>

<p>[20]The man who had received the five talents came forward bringing five more. "Sir," he said, "you entrusted me with five talents; here are five more that I have made."</p>

<p>[20]Uwahawe italanto eshanu araza, azana izindi talanto eshanu ati ‘Databuja, wansigiye italanto eshanu, dore nazigenzuyemo izindi talanto eshanu.'</p>

<p>[21]His master said to him, "Well done, good and trustworthy servant; you have shown you are trustworthy in small things; I will trust you with greater; come and join in your master's happiness."</p>

<p>[21]Shebuja aramubwira ati ‘Nuko nuko mugaragu mwiza ukiranuka, wakiranutse mu bike, nzakwegurira byinshi, injira mu munezero wa shobuja.'</p>

<p>[22]Next the man with the two talents came forward. "Sir," he said, "you entrusted me with two talents; here are two more that I have made."</p>

<p>[22]“N'uwahawe italanto ebyiri araza aravuga ati ‘Databuja, wansigiye italanto ebyiri, dore nazigenzuyemo izindi ebyiri.'</p>

<p>[23]His master said to him, "Well done, good and trustworthy servant; you have shown you are trustworthy in small things; I will trust you with greater; come and join in your master's happiness."</p>

<p>[23]Shebuja aramubwira ati ‘Nuko nuko mugaragu mwiza ukiranuka, wakiranutse mu bike, nzakwegurira byinshi, injira mu munezero wa shobuja.'</p>

<p>[24]Last came forward the man who had the single talent. "Sir," said he, "I had heard you were a hard man, reaping where you had not sown and gathering where you had not scattered;</p>

<p>[24]“N'uwahawe imwe araza aravuga ati ‘Databuja, nari nzi ko uri umunyamwaga, ko usarura aho utabibye, ko uhunika ibyo utagosoye</p>

<p>[25]so I was afraid, and I went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here it is; it was yours, you have it back."</p>

<p>[25]ndatinya, ndagenda mpisha italanto yawe mu butaka. dore ngiyo, ibyawe urabifite.'</p>

<p>[26]But his master answered him, "You wicked and lazy servant! So you knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered?</p>

<p>[26]“Ariko shebuja aramusubiza ati ‘Wa mugaragu mubi we, wa munyabute we, ko wari uzi ko nsarura aho ntabibye, mpunika ibyo ntagosoye,</p>

<p>[27]Well then, you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have got my money back with interest.</p>

<p>[27]italanto yawe ntiwari ukwiriye kuyiha abagenza, nanjye naza ukampana iyanjye n'inyungu yayo?</p>

<p>[28]So now, take the talent from him and give it to the man who has the ten talents.</p>

<p>[28]Nuko nimuyimwake, muyihe ufite italanto cumi.</p>

<p>[29]For to everyone who has will be given more, and he will have more than enough; but anyone who has not, will be deprived even of what he has.</p>

<p>[29]Kuko ufite wese azahabwa akarushirizwaho, ariko udafite azakwa n'icyo yari afite.</p>

<p>[30]As for this good-for-nothing servant, throw him into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."</p>

<p>[30]N'uyu mugaragu nta cyo amaze, mumujugunye mu mwijima hanze. Ni ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo.'</p>

<p>[31]'When the Son of man comes in his glory, escorted by all the angels, then he will take his seat on his throne of glory.</p>

<p>[31]“Umwana w'umuntu ubwo azazana n'abamarayika bose afite ubwiza bwe, ni bwo azicara ku ntebe y'ubwiza bwe.</p>

<p>[32]All nations will be assembled before him and he will separate people one from another as the shepherd separates sheep from goats.</p>

<p>[32]Amahanga yose azateranirizwa imbere ye, abarobanure nk'uko umwungeri arobanura intama mu ihene,</p>

<p>[33]He will place the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.</p>

<p>[33]intama azazishyira iburyo bwe, naho ihene azishyire ibumoso.</p>

<p>[34]Then the King will say to those on his right hand, "Come, you whom my Father has blessed, take as your heritage the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world.</p>

<p>[34]Umwami azabwira abari iburyo bwe ati ‘Nimuze mwebwe abo Data yahaye umugisha, muragwe ubwami bwabatunganirijwe uhereye ku kuremwa kw'isi,</p>

<p>[35]For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you made me welcome,</p>

<p>[35]kuko nari nshonje mukamfungurira, nari mfite inyota mumpa icyo nywa, nari umushyitsi murancumbikira,</p>

<p>[36]lacking clothes and you clothed me, sick and you visited me, in prison and you came to see me."</p>

<p>[36]nari nambaye ubusa muranyambika, nari ndwaye muransūra, nari mu nzu y'imbohe muza kundeba.'</p>

<p>[37]Then the upright will say to him in reply, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?</p>

<p>[37]“Abakiranutsi bazamubaza bati ‘Mwami, twakubonye ryari ushonje turagufungurira, cyangwa ufite inyota tuguha icyo unywa?</p>

<p>[38]When did we see you a stranger and make you welcome, lacking clothes and clothe you?</p>

<p>[38]Kandi twakubonye ryari uri umushyitsi turagucumbikira, cyangwa wambaye ubusa turakwambika?</p>

<p>[39]When did we find you sick or in prison and go to see you?"</p>

<p>[39]Kandi twakubonye ryari urwaye, cyangwa uri mu nzu y'imbohe tuza kugusūra?'</p>

<p>[40]And the King will answer, "In truth I tell you, in so far as you did this to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me."</p>

<p>[40]Umwami azabasubiza ati ‘Ndababwira ukuri yuko ubwo mwabikoreye umwe muri bene Data aba boroheje bari hanyuma y'abandi, ari jye mwabikoreye.'</p>

<p>[41]Then he will say to those on his left hand, "Go away from me, with your curse upon you, to the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</p>

<p>[41]“Azabwira n'abari ibumoso ati ‘Nimuve aho ndi mwa bivume mwe, mujye mu muriro w'iteka watunganirijwe Umwanzi n'abamarayika be,</p>

<p>[42]For I was hungry and you never gave me food, I was thirsty and you never gave me anything to drink,</p>

<p>[42]kuko nari nshonje ntimumfungurire, nari mfite inyota ntimwampa icyo nywa,</p>

<p>[43]I was a stranger and you never made me welcome, lacking clothes and you never clothed me, sick and in prison and you never visited me."</p>

<p>[43]nari umushyitsi ntimwancumbikira, nari nambaye ubusa ntimwanyambika, nari umurwayi no mu nzu y'imbohe ntimwansūra.'</p>

<p>[44]Then it will be their turn to ask, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or lacking clothes, sick or in prison, and did not come to your help?"</p>

<p>[44]“Na bo bazamusubiza bati ‘Mwami, twakubonye ryari ushonje, cyangwa ufite inyota, cyangwa uri umushyitsi, cyangwa wambaye ubusa, cyangwa urwaye, cyangwa uri mu nzu y'imbohe, ntitwagukorera?'</p>

<p>[45]Then he will answer, "In truth I tell you, in so far as you neglected to do this to one of the least of these, you neglected to do it to me."</p>

<p>[45]Azabasubiza ati ‘Ndababwira ukuri yuko ubwo mutabikoreye umwe muri bene Data aba boroheje bari hanyuma y'abandi, nanjye mutabinkoreye.'</p>

<p>[46]And they will go away to eternal punishment, and the upright to eternal life.'</p>

<p>[46]Abo bazajya mu ihaniro ry'iteka, naho abakiranutsi bazajya mu bugingo buhoraho.”
