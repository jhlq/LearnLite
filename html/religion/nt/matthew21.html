<h1>Matthew 21:1-46</h1>

<p>Mt 21:1-11,0,12-46</p>

<p>[1]When they were near Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,</p>

<p>[1]Bageze bugufi bw'i Yerusalemu, bajya i Betifage ku musozi wa Elayono, maze Yesu atuma abigishwa babiri</p>

<p>[2]saying to them, 'Go to the village facing you, and you will at once find a tethered donkey and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.</p>

<p>[2]arababwira ati “Mujye mu kirorero kiri imbere, uwo mwanya muri bubone indogobe izirikanye n'iyayo, muziziture muzinzanire.</p>

<p>[3]If anyone says anything to you, you are to say, "The Master needs them and will send them back at once." '</p>

<p>[3]Ariko nihagira umuntu ubabaza ijambo, mumubwire muti ‘Databuja ni we uzishaka', maze araherako azibahe.”</p>

<p>[4]This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet:</p>

<p>[4]Ibyo byabereyeho kugira ngo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi bisohore ngo</p>

<p>[5]Say to the daughter of Zion: Look, your king is approaching, humble and riding on a donkey and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.</p>

<p>[5]“Mubwire umukobwa w'i Siyoni muti‘Dore umwami wawe aje aho uri,Ari uw'ineza ahetswe n'indogobe,N'icyana cy'indogobe.' ”</p>

<p>[6]So the disciples went and did as Jesus had told them.</p>

<p>[6]Ba bigishwa baragenda bakora nk'uko Yesu yabategetse,</p>

<p>[7]They brought the donkey and the colt, then they laid their cloaks on their backs and he took his seat on them.</p>

<p>[7]bazana indogobe n'iyayo baziteguraho imyenda yabo, ayicaraho.</p>

<p>[8]Great crowds of people spread their cloaks on the road, while others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in his path.</p>

<p>[8]Haza rubanda rwinshi, abenshi muri bo basasa imyenda yabo mu nzira, abandi baca amashami y'ibiti bayasasa mu nzira.</p>

<p>[9]The crowds who went in front of him and those who followed were all shouting: Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heavens!</p>

<p>[9]Itara ry'abantu bamushagaye bararangurura bati “Hoziyana mwene Dawidi, hahirwa uje mu izina ry'Uwiteka! Hoziyana ahasumba hose!”</p>

<p>[10]And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil as people asked, 'Who is this?'</p>

<p>[10]Ageze i Yerusalemu ab'umurwa bose barashika, barabaza bati “Uriya ni nde?”</p>

<p>[11]and the crowds answered, 'This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.'</p>

<p>[11]Barabasubiza bati “Ni umuhanuzi Yesu w'i Nazareti y'i Galilaya.” [0](Mar 11.15-18; Luka 19.45-48; Yoh 2.13-22)</p>

<p>[12]Jesus then went into the Temple and drove out all those who were selling and buying there; he upset the tables of the money-changers and the seats of the dove-sellers.</p>

<p>[12]Nuko Yesu yinjira mu rusengero rw'Imana, yirukanamo abaruguriragamo bose, yubika ameza y'abavunjaga ifeza n'intebe z'abaguraga inuma,</p>

<p>[13]He said to them, 'According to scripture, my house will be called a house of prayer; but you are turning it into a bandits' den.'</p>

<p>[13]arababwira ati “Byanditswe ngo ‘Inzu yanjye izitwa inzu yo gusengerwamo', ariko mwebwe mwayihinduye isenga y'abambuzi.”</p>

<p>[14]There were also blind and lame people who came to him in the Temple, and he cured them.</p>

<p>[14]Nuko impumyi n'ibirema bamusanga mu rusengero arabakiza.</p>

<p>[15]At the sight of the wonderful things he did and of the children shouting, 'Hosanna to the son of David' in the Temple, the chief priests and the scribes were indignant and said to him,</p>

<p>[15]Ariko abatambyi bakuru n'abanditsi babonye ibitangaza akoze, n'abana bavugiye mu rusengero amajwi arenga bati “Hoziyana mwene Dawidi”, bararakara.</p>

<p>[16]'Do you hear what they are saying?' Jesus answered, 'Yes. Have you never read this: By the mouths of children, babes in arms, you have made sure of praise?'</p>

<p>[16]Baramubaza bati “Aho urumva ibyo aba bavuga?”Yesu arabasubiza ati “Yee, ntimwari mwasoma ngo ‘Mu kanwa k'abana bato n'abonka wabonyemo ishimwe ritagira inenge'?”</p>

<p>[17]With that he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.</p>

<p>[17]Arabasiga asohoka mu murwa, ajya i Betaniya ararayo.</p>

<p>[18]As he was returning to the city in the early morning, he felt hungry.</p>

<p>[18]Bukeye bwaho mu gitondo kare asubira mu murwa, arasonza.</p>

<p>[19]Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it and found nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it, 'May you never bear fruit again,' and instantly the fig tree withered.</p>

<p>[19]Abona umutini iruhande rw'inzira arawegera, asanga utariho imbuto keretse ibibabi gusa, arawubwira ati “Ntukere imbuto iteka ryose.” Muri ako kanya uruma.</p>

<p>[20]The disciples were amazed when they saw it and said, 'How is it that the fig tree withered instantly?'</p>

<p>[20]Abigishwa babibonye baratangara bati “Mbega uhereye ko wuma muri ako kanya?”</p>

<p>[21]Jesus answered, 'In truth I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt at all, not only will you do what I have done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, "Be pulled up and thrown into the sea," it will be done.</p>

<p>[21]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko mufite kwizera mudashidikanya, mutakora nk'iby'umutini gusa, ahubwo mwabwira n'uyu musozi muti ‘Shinguka utabwe mu nyanja', byabaho.</p>

<p>[22]And if you have faith, everything you ask for in prayer, you will receive.'</p>

<p>[22]Kandi ibyo muzasaba mwizeye muzabihabwa byose.”</p>

<p>[23]He had gone into the Temple and was teaching, when the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, 'What authority have you for acting like this? And who gave you this authority?'</p>

<p>[23]Yinjiye mu rusengero, abatambyi bakuru n'abakuru b'ubwo bwoko baza aho ari yigisha, baramubaza bati “Ufite butware ki bugutera gukora ibyo? Ni nde wabuguhaye?”</p>

<p>[24]In reply Jesus said to them, 'And I will ask you a question, just one; if you tell me the answer to it, then I will tell you my authority for acting like this.</p>

<p>[24]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Nanjye reka mbabaze ijambo rimwe, nimurinsubiza nanjye ndababwira ubutware buntera kubikora.</p>

<p>[25]John's baptism: what was its origin, heavenly or human?' And they argued this way among themselves, 'If we say heavenly, he will retort to us, "Then why did you refuse to believe him?";</p>

<p>[25]Kubatiza kwa Yohana kwavuye he, ni mu ijuru cyangwa ni mu bantu?”Nuko biburanya mu mitima yabo bati “Nituvuga yuko kwavuye mu ijuru aratubaza ati ‘Ni iki cyababujije kumwemera?'</p>

<p>[26]but if we say human, we have the people to fear, for they all hold that John was a prophet.'</p>

<p>[26]Nituvuga yuko kwavuye mu bantu, dutinya ko abantu batugaya kuko bose bemera ko Yohana yari umuhanuzi.”</p>

<p>[27]So their reply to Jesus was, 'We do not know.' And he retorted to them, 'Nor will I tell you my authority for acting like this.'</p>

<p>[27]Ni ko gusubiza Yesu bati “Ntitubizi.”Na we arababwira ati “Nuko rero nanjye simbabwira ubutware buntera gukora ibyo.</p>

<p>[28]'What is your opinion? A man had two sons. He went and said to the first, "My boy, go and work in the vineyard today."</p>

<p>[28]“Ariko ibi mubitekereza mute? Habayeho umuntu wari ufite abana babiri, asanga umukuru aramubwira ati ‘Mwana wanjye, genda uhingire uruzabibu rwanjye.'</p>

<p>[29]He answered, "I will not go," but afterwards thought better of it and went.</p>

<p>[29]Na we aramusubiza ati ‘Ndanze.' Maze hanyuma arihana aragenda.</p>

<p>[30]The man then went and said the same thing to the second who answered, "Certainly, sir," but did not go.</p>

<p>[30]Se asanga uwa kabiri amubwira atyo, na we aramusubiza ati ‘Ndagiye data', ariko ntiyajyayo.</p>

<p>[31]Which of the two did the father's will?' They said, 'The first.' Jesus said to them, 'In truth I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes are making their way into the kingdom of God before you.</p>

<p>[31]Muri abo bombi ni nde wakoze icyo se ashaka?”Baramusubiza bati “Ni uwa mbere.”Yesu arababwira ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko abakoresha b'ikoro n'abamaraya bababanziriza kwinjira mu bwami bw'Imana.</p>

<p>[32]For John came to you, showing the way of uprightness, but you did not believe him, and yet the tax collectors and prostitutes did. Even after seeing that, you refused to think better of it and believe in him.</p>

<p>[32]Dore Yohana yaje muri mwe agendera mu nzira yo gukiranuka ntimwamwemera, nyamara abakoresha b'ikoro n'abamaraya bo baramwemeye, ariko nubwo mwabibonye mutyo ntimurakihana ngo mumwemere.</p>

<p>[33]'Listen to another parable. There was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard; he fenced it round, dug a winepress in it and built a tower; then he leased it to tenants and went abroad.</p>

<p>[33]“Mwumve undi mugani: Habayeho umuntu wari ufite urugo, atera uruzabibu azitiraho uruzitiro, acukuramo urwina, yubakamo umunara, asigamo abahinzi ajya mu kindi gihugu.</p>

<p>[34]When vintage time drew near he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his produce.</p>

<p>[34]Nuko igihe cyo gusarura cyenda kugera, atuma abagaragu be ku bahinzi ngo babahe imbuto ze.</p>

<p>[35]But the tenants seized his servants, thrashed one, killed another and stoned a third.</p>

<p>[35]Maze abahinzi bafata abagaragu be, umwe baramukubita undi baramwica, undi bamutera amabuye.</p>

<p>[36]Next he sent some more servants, this time a larger number, and they dealt with them in the same way.</p>

<p>[36]Yongera gutuma abandi bagaragu baruta aba mbere, na bo babagira batyo.</p>

<p>[37]Finally he sent his son to them thinking, "They will respect my son."</p>

<p>[37]Hanyuma abatumaho umwana we ati ‘Bazubaha umwana wanjye.'</p>

<p>[38]But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, "This is the heir. Come on, let us kill him and take over his inheritance."</p>

<p>[38]Maze abahinzi babonye mwene shebuja baravugana bati ‘Uyu ni we mutware, nimucyo tumwice ubutware bube ubwacu.'</p>

<p>[39]So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</p>

<p>[39]Nuko baramufata bamwirukana mu ruzabibu, baramwica.</p>

<p>[40]Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?'</p>

<p>[40]“Mbese nyir'uruzabibu naza, abo bahinzi azabagenza ate?”</p>

<p>[41]They answered, 'He will bring those wretches to a wretched end and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will deliver the produce to him at the proper time.'</p>

<p>[41]Baramusubiza bati “Abo bagome azabarimbura bibi, maze uruzabibu arusigemo abandi bahinzi bazajya bamuha imbuto za rwo igihe cya zo.”</p>

<p>[42]Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this is the Lord's doing and we marvel at it?</p>

<p>[42]Yesu arababaza ati “Ntimwari mwasoma mu byanditswe ngo‘Ibuye abubatsi banze,Ni ryo ryahindutse irikomeza imfuruka!Ibyo byavuye ku Uwiteka,Kandi ni ibitangaza mu maso yacu.'</p>

<p>[43]'I tell you, then, that the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.'</p>

<p>[43]“Ni cyo gitumye mbabwira yuko ubwami bw'Imana muzabunyagwa, bugahabwa ishyanga ryera imbuto zabwo. [</p>

<p>[44]</p>

<p>[44]Kandi uzagwira iryo buye azavunagurika, ariko uwo rizagwira wese, rizamumenagura rimugire ifu.]”</p>

<p>[45]When they heard his parables, the chief priests and the scribes realised he was speaking about them,</p>

<p>[45]Abatambyi bakuru n'Abafarisayo bumvise imigani ye bamenya yuko ari bo avuga.</p>

<p>[46]but though they would have liked to arrest him they were afraid of the crowds, who looked on him as a prophet.</p>

<p>[46]Bashaka kumufata ariko batinya rubanda, kuko bemeraga ko ari umuhanuzi.
