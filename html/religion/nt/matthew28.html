<h1>Matthew 28:1-20</h1>

<p>Mt 28:1-20</p>

<p>[1]After the Sabbath, and towards dawn on the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary went to visit the sepulchre.</p>

<p>[1]Nuko umunsi w'isabato ushize, ku wa mbere w'iminsi irindwi, umuseke wenda gutambika, Mariya Magadalena na Mariya wundi bajya kureba cya gituro.</p>

<p>[2]And suddenly there was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat on it.</p>

<p>[2]Habaho igishyitsi cyinshi, kuko marayika w'Umwami Imana yari amanutse avuye mu ijuru, abirindura igitare acyicaraho.</p>

<p>[3]His face was like lightning, his robe white as snow.</p>

<p>[3]Ishusho ye yasaga n'umurabyo, n'imyenda ye yeraga nk'urubura.</p>

<p>[4]The guards were so shaken by fear of him that they were like dead men.</p>

<p>[4]Ba barinzi bamubonye bagira ubwoba bahinda imishitsi, basa n'abapfuye.</p>

<p>[5]But the angel spoke; and he said to the women, 'There is no need for you to be afraid. I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</p>

<p>[5]Ariko marayika abwira abagore ati “Mwebweho mwitinya, kuko nzi yuko mushaka Yesu wabambwe.</p>

<p>[6]He is not here, for he has risen, as he said he would. Come and see the place where he lay,</p>

<p>[6]Ntari hano kuko yazutse nk'uko yavuze, nimuze murebe aho Umwami yari aryamye.</p>

<p>[7]then go quickly and tell his disciples, "He has risen from the dead and now he is going ahead of you to Galilee; that is where you will see him." Look! I have told you.'</p>

<p>[7]Nimugende vuba mubwire abigishwa be yuko yazutse, kandi azababanziriza kujya i Galilaya. Iyo ni ho muzamubonera dore ndabibabwiye.”</p>

<p>[8]Filled with awe and great joy the women came quickly away from the tomb and ran to tell his disciples.</p>

<p>[8]Bava mu gituro vuba bafite ubwoba n'ibinezaneza byinshi, birukanka bajya kubibwira abigishwa be.</p>

<p>[9]And suddenly, coming to meet them, was Jesus. 'Greetings,' he said. And the women came up to him and, clasping his feet, they did him homage.</p>

<p>[9]Maze Yesu ahura na bo arababwira ati “Ni amahoro!” Baramwegera bamufata ku birenge, baramupfukamira.</p>

<p>[10]Then Jesus said to them, 'Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers that they must leave for Galilee; there they will see me.'</p>

<p>[10]Maze Yesu arababwira ati “Mwitinya, nimugende mubwire bene Data bajye i Galilaya, ni ho bazambonera.”</p>

<p>[11]Now while they were on their way, some of the guards went off into the city to tell the chief priests all that had happened.</p>

<p>[11]Bakigenda, bamwe muri ba barinzi bajya mu murwa babwira abatambyi bakuru ibyabaye byose.</p>

<p>[12]These held a meeting with the elders and, after some discussion, handed a considerable sum of money to the soldiers</p>

<p>[12]Bateranira hamwe n'abakuru bajya inama, bagurira abasirikare ifeza nyinshi</p>

<p>[13]with these instructions, 'This is what you must say, "His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep."</p>

<p>[13]bati “Mujye muvuga muti ‘Abigishwa be baje nijoro dusinziriye, baramwiba.'</p>

<p>[14]And should the governor come to hear of this, we undertake to put things right with him ourselves and to see that you do not get into trouble.'</p>

<p>[14]Umutegeka naramuka abyumvise tuzamwemeza, namwe tuzabakiza amakuba.”</p>

<p>[15]So they took the money and carried out their instructions, and to this day that is the story among the Jews.</p>

<p>[15]Nuko baherako bijyanira ifeza, babigenza uko bohejwe. Iryo jambo ryamamara mu Bayuda na bugingo n'ubu.</p>

<p>[16]Meanwhile the eleven disciples set out for Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had arranged to meet them.</p>

<p>[16]Nuko abigishwa cumi n'umwe bajya i Galilaya ku musozi Yesu yabategetse.</p>

<p>[17]When they saw him they fell down before him, though some hesitated.</p>

<p>[17]Bamubonye baramupfukamira, ariko bamwe barashidikanya.</p>

<p>[18]Jesus came up and spoke to them. He said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</p>

<p>[18]Nuko Yesu arabegera avugana na bo ati “Nahawe ubutware bwose mu ijuru no mu isi.</p>

<p>[19]Go, therefore, make disciples of all nations; baptise them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</p>

<p>[19]Nuko mugende muhindure abantu bo mu mahanga yose abigishwa, mubabatiza mu izina rya Data wa twese n'Umwana n'Umwuka Wera,</p>

<p>[20]and teach them to observe all the commands I gave you. And look, I am with you always; yes, to the end of time.'</p>

<p>[20]mubigisha kwitondera ibyo nababwiye byose. Kandi dore ndi kumwe namwe iminsi yose kugeza ku mperuka y'isi.”</p>
