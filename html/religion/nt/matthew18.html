<h1>Matthew 18:1-35</h1>

<p>Mt 18:1-35</p>

<p>[1]At this time the disciples came to Jesus and said, 'Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?'</p>

<p>[1]Icyo gihe abigishwa begera Yesu baramubaza bati “Umukuru mu bwami bwo mu ijuru ni nde?”</p>

<p>[2]So he called a little child to him whom he set among them.</p>

<p>[2]Ahamagara umwana muto amuhagarika hagati yabo,</p>

<p>[3]Then he said, 'In truth I tell you, unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>[3]arababwira ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko nimudahinduka ngo mumere nk'abana bato, mutazinjira mu bwami bwo mu ijuru.</p>

<p>[4]And so, the one who makes himself as little as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>[4]Nuko uzicisha bugufi nk'uyu mwana muto, ni we mukuru mu bwami bwo mu ijuru.</p>

<p>[5]'Anyone who welcomes one little child like this in my name welcomes me.</p>

<p>[5]Uwemera umwana umwe muto nk'uyu mu izina ryanjye, ni jye aba yemeye.</p>

<p>[6]But anyone who is the downfall of one of these little ones who have faith in me would be better drowned in the depths of the sea with a great millstone round his neck.</p>

<p>[6]“Ariko ushuka umwe muri aba bato banyizera akamugusha, ikiruta ni uko yahambirwa urusyo mu ijosi rye, akazikwa imuhengeri mu nyanja.</p>

<p>[7]Alas for the world that there should be such causes of falling! Causes of falling indeed there must be, but alas for anyone who provides them!</p>

<p>[7]Isi izaboneshwa ishyano n'ibigusha abantu, kuko ibyo bigusha bitazabura kuza, ariko uwo muntu uzana ibigusha azabona ishyano.</p>

<p>[8]'If your hand or your foot should be your downfall, cut it off and throw it away: it is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.</p>

<p>[8]“Ariko ukuboko kwawe cyangwa ukuguru kwawe nibigucumuza uguce ugute kure yawe. Ibyiza ni uko wakwinjira mu bugingo usigaranye ukuboko kumwe cyangwa ukuguru, biruta ko wajugunywa mu muriro utazima ufite amaboko yombi cyangwa amaguru yombi.</p>

<p>[9]And if your eye should be your downfall, tear it out and throw it away: it is better for you to enter into life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell of fire.</p>

<p>[9]Cyangwa ijisho ryawe nirikugusha urinogore urite kure yawe. Ibyiza ni uko wakwinjira mu bugingo usigaranye ijisho rimwe gusa, biruta ko wajugunywa muri Gehinomu y'umuriro ufite amaso yombi.</p>

<p>[10]'See that you never despise any of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven are continually in the presence of my Father in heaven.</p>

<p>[10]“Mwirinde mudasuzugura umwe muri aba bana bato. Ndababwira yuko abamarayika babo bo mu ijuru bahora bareba mu maso ha Data wo mu ijuru. [</p>

<p>[11]</p>

<p>[11]Umwana w'umuntu yaje gukiza icyari cyazimiye.]</p>

<p>[12]'Tell me. Suppose a man has a hundred sheep and one of them strays; will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hillside and go in search of the stray?</p>

<p>[12]“Mbese muratekereza mute? Umuntu ufite intama ijana, imwe muri zo iyo izimiye ntasiga izo mirongo urwenda n'icyenda, akajya ku misozi agashaka iyazimiye?</p>

<p>[13]In truth I tell you, if he finds it, it gives him more joy than do the ninety-nine that did not stray at all.</p>

<p>[13]Kandi iyo ayibonye, ndababwira ukuri yuko ayishimira cyane kurusha izo mirongo urwenda n'icyenda zitazimiye.</p>

<p>[14]Similarly, it is never the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.</p>

<p>[14]Nuko So wo mu ijuru ntashaka ko hagira n'umwe muri aba bato urimbuka.</p>

<p>[15]'If your brother does something wrong, go and have it out with him alone, between your two selves. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother.</p>

<p>[15]“Mwene so nakugirira nabi, ugende umumenyeshe icyaha cye mwiherereye, nakumvira uzaba ubonye mwene so.</p>

<p>[16]If he does not listen, take one or two others along with you: whatever the misdemeanour, the evidence of two or three witnesses is required to sustain the charge.</p>

<p>[16]Ariko natakumvira umuteze undi cyangwa babiri, ngo ‘Ijambo ryose rikomere mu kanwa k'abagabo babiri cyangwa batatu.'</p>

<p>[17]But if he refuses to listen to these, report it to the community; and if he refuses to listen to the community, treat him like a gentile or a tax collector.</p>

<p>[17]Kandi niyanga kumvira abo uzabibwire Itorero, niyanga kuryumvira na ryo, azakubeho nk'umupagani cyangwa umukoresha w'ikoro.</p>

<p>[18]'In truth I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.</p>

<p>[18]“Ndababwira ukuri yuko ibyo muzahambira mu isi bizaba bihambiriwe mu ijuru, kandi ibyo muzahambura mu isi bizaba bihambuwe mu ijuru.</p>

<p>[19]'In truth I tell you once again, if two of you on earth agree to ask anything at all, it will be granted to you by my Father in heaven.</p>

<p>[19]“Kandi ndababwira yuko ababiri muri mwe nibahuza umutima mu isi wo kugira icyo basaba cyose, bazagikorerwa na Data wo mu ijuru.</p>

<p>[20]For where two or three meet in my name, I am there among them.'</p>

<p>[20]Kuko aho babiri cyangwa batatu bateraniye mu izina ryanjye, nanjye mba ndi hagati yabo.”</p>

<p>[21]Then Peter went up to him and said, 'Lord, how often must I forgive my brother if he wrongs me? As often as seven times?'</p>

<p>[21]Nuko Petero aramwegera aramubaza ati “Databuja, mwene data nangirira nabi nzamubabarira kangahe? Ngeze karindwi?”</p>

<p>[22]Jesus answered, 'Not seven, I tell you, but seventy-seven times.</p>

<p>[22]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Sinkubwiye yuko ugeza karindwi, ahubwo yuko ugeza mirongo irindwi karindwi.</p>

<p>[23]'And so the kingdom of Heaven may be compared to a king who decided to settle his accounts with his servants.</p>

<p>[23]Ni cyo gituma ubwami bwo mu ijuru bwagereranywa n'umwami washatse kubarana n'abagaragu be umubare w'ibyo yababikije.</p>

<p>[24]When the reckoning began, they brought him a man who owed ten thousand talents;</p>

<p>[24]Abanje kubara, bamuzanira umwe muri bo yishyuza italanto inzovu.</p>

<p>[25]he had no means of paying, so his master gave orders that he should be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions, to meet the debt.</p>

<p>[25]Ariko kuko yari adafite ibyo kwishyura, shebuja ategeka kumugura n'umugore we n'abana be n'ibyo afite byose, ngo umwenda ushire.</p>

<p>[26]At this, the servant threw himself down at his master's feet, with the words, "Be patient with me and I will pay the whole sum."</p>

<p>[26]Umugaragu aramupfukamira aramwinginga ati ‘Mwami, nyihanganira nzakwishyura byose.'</p>

<p>[27]And the servant's master felt so sorry for him that he let him go and cancelled the debt.</p>

<p>[27]Shebuja aramubabarira aramureka, amuharira umwenda.</p>

<p>[28]Now as this servant went out, he happened to meet a fellow-servant who owed him one hundred denarii; and he seized him by the throat and began to throttle him, saying, "Pay what you owe me."</p>

<p>[28]“Ariko uwo mugaragu arasohoka, asanga umugaragu mugenzi we yagurije idenariyo ijana, aramufata aramuniga, aramubwira ati ‘Nyishyura umwenda wanjye.'</p>

<p>[29]His fellow-servant fell at his feet and appealed to him, saying, "Be patient with me and I will pay you."</p>

<p>[29]Umugaragu mugenzi we yikubita hasi, aramwinginga ati ‘Nyihanganira nzakwishyura.'</p>

<p>[30]But the other would not agree; on the contrary, he had him thrown into prison till he should pay the debt.</p>

<p>[30]Ntiyakunda maze aragenda amushyira mu nzu y'imbohe, kugeza aho azamarira kwishyura umwenda.</p>

<p>[31]His fellow-servants were deeply distressed when they saw what had happened, and they went to their master and reported the whole affair to him.</p>

<p>[31]Abagaragu bagenzi be babonye ibibaye barababara cyane, baragenda babibwira shebuja uko bibaye byose.</p>

<p>[32]Then the master sent for the man and said to him, "You wicked servant, I cancelled all that debt of yours when you appealed to me.</p>

<p>[32]Maze shebuja aramuhamagara aramubwira ati ‘Wa mugaragu mubi we, naguhariye wa mwenda wose kuko wanyinginze,</p>

<p>[33]Were you not bound, then, to have pity on your fellow-servant just as I had pity on you?"</p>

<p>[33]nawe ntiwari ukwiriye kubabarira mugenzi wawe nk'uko nakubabariye?'</p>

<p>[34]And in his anger the master handed him over to the torturers till he should pay all his debt.</p>

<p>[34]Shebuja ararakara, amuha abasirikare kugeza aho azamarira kwishyura umwenda wose.</p>

<p>[35]And that is how my heavenly Father will deal with you unless you each forgive your brother from your heart.'</p>

<p>[35]“Na Data wo mu ijuru ni ko azabagira, nimutababarira umuntu wese mwene so mubikuye mu mutima.”
