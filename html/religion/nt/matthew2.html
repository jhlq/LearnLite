<h1>Matthew 2:1-23</h1>

<p>Mt 2:1-23</p>

<p>[1]After Jesus had been born at Bethlehem in Judaea during the reign of King Herod, suddenly some wise men came to Jerusalem from the east</p>

<p>[1]Yesu amaze kuvukira i Betelehemu mu gihugu cy'i Yudaya ku ngoma y'Umwami Herode, haza abanyabwenge baturutse iburasirazuba bajya i Yerusalemu, barabaza bati</p>

<p>[2]asking, 'Where is the infant king of the Jews? We saw his star as it rose and have come to do him homage.'</p>

<p>[2]“Umwami w'Abayuda wavutse ari hehe? Ko twabonye inyenyeri ye turi iburasirazuba, none tukaba tuje kumuramya.”</p>

<p>[3]When King Herod heard this he was perturbed, and so was the whole of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>[3]Umwami Herode abyumvise ahagarikana umutima n'ab'i Yerusalemu bose,</p>

<p>[4]He called together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and enquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</p>

<p>[4]ateranya abatambyi bakuru n'abanditsi bose b'ubwo bwoko, ababaza aho Kristo azavukira aho ari ho.</p>

<p>[5]They told him, 'At Bethlehem in Judaea, for this is what the prophet wrote:</p>

<p>[5]Bati “Ni i Betelehemu mu gihugu cy'i Yudaya. Ni ko byanditswe n'umuhanuzi ngo</p>

<p>[6]And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the leaders of Judah, for from you will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.'</p>

<p>[6]‘Nawe Betelehemu ho mu gihugu cya Yuda,Ni ukuri nturi mutoya mu midugudu ikomeye ya Yuda,Kuko muri wowe ari ho hazaturuka umutware,Uzaragira ubwoko bwanjye bw'Abisirayeli.' ”</p>

<p>[7]Then Herod summoned the wise men to see him privately. He asked them the exact date on which the star had appeared</p>

<p>[7]Nuko Herode ahamagara abanyabwenge rwihishwa, abasobanuza neza igihe baboneye ya nyenyeri,</p>

<p>[8]and sent them on to Bethlehem with the words, 'Go and find out all about the child, and when you have found him, let me know, so that I too may go and do him homage.'</p>

<p>[8]abatuma i Betelehemu ati “Nimugende musobanuze neza iby'uwo mwana. Nimumubona muze mubimbwire, nanjye njye kumuramya.”</p>

<p>[9]Having listened to what the king had to say, they set out. And suddenly the star they had seen rising went forward and halted over the place where the child was.</p>

<p>[9]Bamaze kumva umwami baragenda, kandi ya nyenyeri babonye bakiri iburasirazuba ibajya imbere, irinda igera aho uwo mwana ari ihagarara aho.</p>

<p>[10]The sight of the star filled them with delight,</p>

<p>[10]Babonye iyo nyenyeri baranezerwa cyane.</p>

<p>[11]and going into the house they saw the child with his mother Mary, and falling to their knees they did him homage. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.</p>

<p>[11]Bageze mu nzu basangamo umwana hamwe na nyina Mariya, barapfukama baramuramya. Maze bahambura imitwaro yabo, bamutura amaturo y'izahabu n'icyome n'ishangi.</p>

<p>[12]But they were given a warning in a dream not to go back to Herod, and returned to their own country by a different way.</p>

<p>[12]Baburizwa n'Imana mu nzozi gusubira kwa Herode, banyura iyindi nzira basubira iwabo.</p>

<p>[13]After they had left, suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with you, and escape into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and do away with him.'</p>

<p>[13]Bamaze kugenda marayika w'Umwami Imana araza, abonekera Yosefu mu nzozi ati “Byuka ujyane umwana na nyina uhungire muri Egiputa, ugumeyo ugeze aho nzakubwirira, kuko Herode agenza umwana ngo amwice.”</p>

<p>[14]So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him, left that night for Egypt,</p>

<p>[14]Na we aherako arabyuka ajyana umwana na nyina nijoro, ajya muri Egiputa,</p>

<p>[15]where he stayed until Herod was dead. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: I called my son out of Egypt.</p>

<p>[15]agumayo ageza ubwo Herode amaze gutanga, ngo ibyo Umwami Imana yavugiye mu kanwa k'umuhanuzi bisohore ngo “Nahamagaye umwana wanjye ngo ave muri Egiputa.”</p>

<p>[16]Herod was furious on realising that he had been fooled by the wise men, and in Bethlehem and its surrounding district he had all the male children killed who were two years old or less, reckoning by the date he had been careful to ask the wise men.</p>

<p>[16]Herode abonye ko yatengushywe na ba banyabwenge ararakara cyane, aratuma ngo bice abana b'abahungu bose bari i Betelehemu no mu misozi yose iri bugufi bwaho, bamaze imyaka ibiri n'abatarayimara, nk'uko yagereranyije igihe yasobanuriwe n'abo banyabwenge.</p>

<p>[17]Then were fulfilled the words spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:</p>

<p>[17]Ni bwo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yeremiya byasohoye ngo</p>

<p>[18]A voice is heard in Ramah, lamenting and weeping bitterly: it is Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted because they are no more.</p>

<p>[18]“Induru yumvikaniye i Rama,Yo kurira no kuboroga kwinshi,Rasheli aririra abana be,Yanga guhozwa kuko batakiriho.”</p>

<p>[19]After Herod's death, suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</p>

<p>[19]Herode amaze gupfa, marayika w'Umwami Imana araza, abonekera Yosefu mu nzozi ari mu Egiputa ati</p>

<p>[20]and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with you and go back to the land of Israel, for those who wanted to kill the child are dead.'</p>

<p>[20]“Byuka usubize umwana na nyina mu gihugu cya Isirayeli, kuko abashakaga kumwica bapfuye.”</p>

<p>[21]So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him, went back to the land of Israel.</p>

<p>[21]Arabyuka ajyana umwana na nyina, asubira mu gihugu cya Isirayeli.</p>

<p>[22]But when he learnt that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as ruler of Judaea he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the region of Galilee.</p>

<p>[22]Ariko yumvise yuko Arikelayo yimye i Yudaya aha se Herode atinya kujyayo, abwirizwa n'Imana mu nzozi ajya mu gihugu cy'i Galilaya,</p>

<p>[23]There he settled in a town called Nazareth. In this way the words spoken through the prophets were to be fulfilled: He will be called a Nazarene.</p>

<p>[23]atura mu mudugudu witwa i Nazareti ngo ibyavuzwe n'abahanuzi bisohore ngo “Azitwa Umunazareti.”
