<h1>Matthew 20:1-34</h1>

<p>Mt 20:1-34</p>

<p>[1]'Now the kingdom of Heaven is like a landowner going out at daybreak to hire workers for his vineyard.</p>

<p>[1]“Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bwagereranywa n'umuntu ufite urugo, yazindutse kare gushaka abahinzi ngo bahingire uruzabibu rwe.</p>

<p>[2]He made an agreement with the workers for one denarius a day and sent them to his vineyard.</p>

<p>[2]Asezerana n'abahinzi idenariyo ku munsi umwe, abohereza mu ruzabibu rwe.</p>

<p>[3]Going out at about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the market place</p>

<p>[3]Isaha eshatu arasohoka, asanga abandi bahagaze mu iguriro nta cyo bakora,</p>

<p>[4]and said to them, "You go to my vineyard too and I will give you a fair wage."</p>

<p>[4]na bo arababwira ati ‘Namwe mujye mu ruzabibu rwanjye ndi bubahe ibikwiriye.'</p>

<p>[5]So they went. At about the sixth hour and again at about the ninth hour, he went out and did the same.</p>

<p>[5]Baragenda. Yongera gusohoka mu isaha esheshatu n'isaha cyenda, abigenza atyo.</p>

<p>[6]Then at about the eleventh hour he went out and found more men standing around, and he said to them, "Why have you been standing here idle all day?"</p>

<p>[6]Isaha zibaye cumi n'imwe arasohoka, asanga abandi bahagaze arababaza ati ‘Ni iki kibahagaritse hano umunsi wose nta cyo mukora?'</p>

<p>[7]"Because no one has hired us," they answered. He said to them, "You go into my vineyard too."</p>

<p>[7]Baramusubiza bati ‘Kuko ari nta waduhaye umurimo.' Arababwira ati ‘Namwe mujye mu ruzabibu rwanjye.'</p>

<p>[8]In the evening, the owner of the vineyard said to his bailiff, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last arrivals and ending with the first."</p>

<p>[8]“Bugorobye nyir'uruzabibu abwira igisonga cye ati ‘Hamagara abahinzi ubahe ibihembo byabo, utangirire ku ba nyuma ugeze ku ba mbere.'</p>

<p>[9]So those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came forward and received one denarius each.</p>

<p>[9]Abatangiye mu isaha cumi n'imwe baje, umuntu wese ahabwa idenariyo imwe.</p>

<p>[10]When the first came, they expected to get more, but they too received one denarius each.</p>

<p>[10]Ababanje baje bibwira ko bahembwa ibirutaho, ariko umuntu wese ahembwa idenariyo imwe.</p>

<p>[11]They took it, but grumbled at the landowner saying,</p>

<p>[11]Bazihawe bitotombera nyir'uruzabibu bati</p>

<p>[12]"The men who came last have done only one hour, and you have treated them the same as us, though we have done a heavy day's work in all the heat."</p>

<p>[12]‘Aba ba nyuma bakoze isaha imwe, ubanganyije natwe abahingitse umunsi wose tuvunika, twicwa n'izuba!'</p>

<p>[13]He answered one of them and said, "My friend, I am not being unjust to you; did we not agree on one denarius?</p>

<p>[13]“Na we asubiza umwe muri bo ati ‘Mugenzi wanjye, sinkugiriye nabi. Ntuzi ko twasezeranye idenariyo imwe?</p>

<p>[14]Take your earnings and go. I choose to pay the lastcomer as much as I pay you.</p>

<p>[14]Ngiyo yijyane ugende. Ko nshatse guhemba uwa nyuma nkawe,</p>

<p>[15]Have I no right to do what I like with my own? Why should you be envious because I am generous?"</p>

<p>[15]mbese hari icyambuza kugenza ibyanjye uko nshaka, ko undeba igitsure, kuko ngize ubuntu!'</p>

<p>[16]Thus the last will be first, and the first, last.'</p>

<p>[16]“Uko ni ko ab'inyuma bazaba ab'imbere, kandi ab'imbere bazaba ab'inyuma.”</p>

<p>[17]Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, and on the road he took the Twelve aside by themselves and said to them,</p>

<p>[17]Yesu yenda kuzamuka ngo ajye i Yerusalemu, yihererana n'abo cumi na babiri, ababwirira mu nzira ati</p>

<p>[18]'Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man is about to be handed over to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn him to death</p>

<p>[18]“Dore turazamuka tujya i Yerusalemu, Umwana w'umuntu azagambanirwa mu batambyi bakuru n'abanditsi, bamucire urubanza rwo kumwica.</p>

<p>[19]and will hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified; and on the third day he will be raised up again.'</p>

<p>[19]Bazamugambanira mu bapagani bamushinyagurire, bamukubite imikoba bamubambe, ku munsi wa gatatu azazurwa.”</p>

<p>[20]Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came with her sons to make a request of him, and bowed low;</p>

<p>[20]Maze nyina wa bene Zebedayo azana n'abana be aho ari, aramupfukamira ngo agire icyo amusaba.</p>

<p>[21]and he said to her, 'What is it you want?' She said to him, 'Promise that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom.'</p>

<p>[21]Na we aramubaza ati “Urashaka iki?”Aramusubiza ati “Tegeka ko aba bana banjye bombi bazicara mu bwami bwawe, umwe iburyo bwawe undi ibumoso.”</p>

<p>[22]Jesus answered, 'You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?' They replied, 'We can.'</p>

<p>[22]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Ntimuzi icyo musaba. Mwabasha kunywera ku gikombe nzanyweraho?”Bati “Turabibasha.”</p>

<p>[23]He said to them, 'Very well; you shall drink my cup, but as for seats at my right hand and my left, these are not mine to grant; they belong to those to whom they have been allotted by my Father.'</p>

<p>[23]Arababwira ati “Ni ukuri igikombe cyanjye muzakinyweraho, ariko kwicara iburyo bwanjye n'ibumoso si jye ubigaba, keretse abo Data yabitunganyirije.”</p>

<p>[24]When the other ten heard this they were indignant with the two brothers.</p>

<p>[24]Ba bandi cumi babyumvise barakarira abo bavandimwe bombi.</p>

<p>[25]But Jesus called them to him and said, 'You know that among the gentiles the rulers lord it over them, and great men make their authority felt.</p>

<p>[25]Yesu arabahamagara arababwira ati “Muzi yuko abami b'abanyamahanga babatwaza igitugu, n'abakomeye babo bahawe kubategeka.</p>

<p>[26]Among you this is not to happen. No; anyone who wants to become great among you must be your servant,</p>

<p>[26]Ariko muri mwe si ko biri, ahubwo ushaka kuba mukuru muri mwe ajye aba umugaragu wanyu,</p>

<p>[27]and anyone who wants to be first among you must be your slave,</p>

<p>[27]kandi ushaka kuba uw'imbere muri mwe, ajye aba imbata yanyu,</p>

<p>[28]just as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.'</p>

<p>[28]nk'uko Umwana w'umuntu ataje gukorerwa, ahubwo yaje gukorera abandi no gutangira ubugingo bwe kuba incungu ya benshi.”</p>

<p>[29]As they left Jericho a large crowd followed him.</p>

<p>[29]Bakiva i Yeriko, abantu benshi baramukurikira.</p>

<p>[30]And now there were two blind men sitting at the side of the road. When they heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, they shouted, 'Lord! Have pity on us, son of David.'</p>

<p>[30]Impumyi ebyiri zari zicaye iruhande rw'inzira, zumvise yuko Yesu ahanyura, zirataka cyane ziti “Mwami mwene Dawidi, tubabarire.”</p>

<p>[31]And the crowd scolded them and told them to keep quiet, but they only shouted the louder, 'Lord! Have pity on us, son of David.'</p>

<p>[31]Abantu barazicyaha ngo zihore, ariko zirushaho gutaka ziti “Mwami mwene Dawidi, tubabarire.”</p>

<p>[32]Jesus stopped, called them over and said, 'What do you want me to do for you?'</p>

<p>[32]Yesu arahagarara arazihamagara, arazibaza ati “Murashaka ko mbagirira nte?”</p>

<p>[33]They said to him, 'Lord, let us have our sight back.'</p>

<p>[33]Ziramusubiza ziti “Mwami, amaso yacu ahumuke.”</p>

<p>[34]Jesus felt pity for them and touched their eyes, and at once their sight returned and they followed him.</p>

<p>[34]Yesu azigirira imbabazi akora ku maso yazo, uwo mwanya zirahumuka, baramukurikira.
