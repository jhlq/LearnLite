<h1>Matthew 12:1-50</h1>

<p>Mt 12:1-50</p>

<p>[1]At that time Jesus went through the cornfields one Sabbath day. His disciples were hungry and began to pick ears of corn and eat them.</p>

<p>[1]Nuko icyo gihe Yesu agenda anyura mu mirima y'amasaka ku isabato, abigishwa be barasonza, batangira guca amahundo barayahekenya.</p>

<p>[2]The Pharisees noticed it and said to him, 'Look, your disciples are doing something that is forbidden on the Sabbath.'</p>

<p>[2]Maze Abafarisayo bababonye baramubwira bati “Dore abigishwa bawe ko bakora ibizira ku isabato!”</p>

<p>[3]But he said to them, 'Have you not read what David did when he and his followers were hungry-</p>

<p>[3]Na we arababaza ati “Mbese ntimwasomye icyo Dawidi yakoze ubwo yasonzanaga n'abo bari bari kumwe,</p>

<p>[4]how he went into the house of God and they ate the loaves of the offering although neither he nor his followers were permitted to eat them, but only the priests?</p>

<p>[4]ko yinjiye mu nzu y'Imana akarya imitsima yo kumurikwa, amategeko atemeye ko ayirya cyangwa abo bari bari kumwe, keretse abatambyi bonyine?</p>

<p>[5]Or again, have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath day the Temple priests break the Sabbath without committing any fault?</p>

<p>[5]Cyangwa ntimwasomye mu mategeko, uko abatambyi bazirura isabato bari mu rusengero, nyamara ntibabeho umugayo?</p>

<p>[6]Now here, I tell you, is something greater than the Temple.</p>

<p>[6]Ariko ndababwira yuko uruta urusengero ari hano.</p>

<p>[7]And if you had understood the meaning of the words: Mercy is what pleases me, not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the blameless.</p>

<p>[7]Iyaba mwari muzi uko iri jambo risobanurwa ngo ‘Nkunda imbabazi kuruta ibitambo' ntimwagaya abatariho urubanza,</p>

<p>[8]For the Son of man is master of the Sabbath.'</p>

<p>[8]kuko Umwana w'umuntu ari Umwami w'isabato.”</p>

<p>[9]He moved on from there and went to their synagogue;</p>

<p>[9]Avayo ajya mu isinagogi yabo,</p>

<p>[10]now a man was there with a withered hand. They asked him, 'Is it permitted to cure somebody on the Sabbath day?' hoping for something to charge him with.</p>

<p>[10]asangamo umuntu unyunyutse ukuboko. Babaza Yesu bati “Mbese amategeko yemera gukiza umuntu ku isabato?” Ni ko bamubajije ngo babone uko bamurega.</p>

<p>[11]But he said to them, 'If any one of you here had only one sheep and it fell down a hole on the Sabbath day, would he not get hold of it and lift it out?</p>

<p>[11]Arabasubiza ati “Ni nde muri mwe waba afite intama imwe, ikagwa mu mwobo ku isabato ntayikuremo?</p>

<p>[12]Now a man is far more important than a sheep, so it follows that it is permitted on the Sabbath day to do good.'</p>

<p>[12]Mbese umuntu ntaruta intama cyane? Nuko rero amategeko ntabuzanya gukora neza ku isabato.”</p>

<p>[13]Then he said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.' He stretched it out and his hand was restored, as sound as the other one.</p>

<p>[13]Maze abwira uwo muntu ati “Rambura ukuboko kwawe.”Arakurambura, kurakira kuba nk'ukundi.</p>

<p>[14]At this the Pharisees went out and began to plot against him, discussing how to destroy him.</p>

<p>[14]Abafarisayo barasohoka bajya inama, ngo babone uko bazamwica.</p>

<p>[15]Jesus knew this and withdrew from the district. Many followed him and he cured them all</p>

<p>[15]Yesu abimenye arahava, abantu benshi bajyana na we abakiza bose,</p>

<p>[16]but warned them not to make him known.</p>

<p>[16]arabahana ngo batamwamamaza</p>

<p>[17]This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:</p>

<p>[17]ngo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yesaya bisohore ngo</p>

<p>[18]Look! My servant whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul delights, I will send my Spirit upon him, and he will present judgement to the nations;</p>

<p>[18]“Dore umugaragu wanjye nkunda natoranyije,Umutima wanjye ukamwishimira.Nzamushyiramo Umwuka wanjye,Azamenyesha abanyamahanga ibyo gukiranuka.</p>

<p>[19]he will not brawl or cry out, his voice is not heard in the streets,</p>

<p>[19]Ntazatongana, ntazasakuza,Ndetse no mu nzira nta wuzumva ijwi rye.</p>

<p>[20]he will not break the crushed reed, or snuff the faltering wick,</p>

<p>[20]Urubingo rusadutse ntazaruvuna,Kandi n'urumuri rucumba ntazaruzimya,Kugeza ubwo azaneshesha gukiranuka kwe,</p>

<p>[21]until he has made judgement victorious; in him the nations will put their hope.</p>

<p>[21]kandi izina rye abanyamahanga bazaryizigira.”</p>

<p>[22]Then they brought to him a blind and dumb demoniac; and he cured him, so that the dumb man could speak and see.</p>

<p>[22]Maze bamuzanira impumyi yari ikiragi itewe na dayimoni, arayikiza. Uwari ikiragi avuga ubwo kandi arahumuka.</p>

<p>[23]All the people were astounded and said, 'Can this be the son of David?'</p>

<p>[23]Abantu bose baratangara baravuga bati “Mbese aho uyu si we mwene Dawidi?”</p>

<p>[24]But when the Pharisees heard this they said, 'The man drives out devils only through Beelzebul, the chief of the devils.'</p>

<p>[24]Ariko Abafarisayo babyumvise baravuga bati “Uyu nta wundi umuha kwirukana abadayimoni, keretse Belizebuli umutware w'abadayimoni.”</p>

<p>[25]Knowing what was in their minds he said to them, 'Every kingdom divided against itself is heading for ruin; and no town, no household divided against itself can last.</p>

<p>[25]Amenye ibyo bibwira arababwira ati “Ubwami bwose iyo bwigabanyije ubwabwo burarimbuka, n'umudugudu wose cyangwa inzu yose, iyo byigabanyije ubwabyo ntibigumaho.</p>

<p>[26]Now if Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself; so how can his kingdom last?</p>

<p>[26]None se Satani niba yirukana Satani ko aba yigabanyije ubwe, ubwami bwe buzagumaho bute?</p>

<p>[27]And if it is through Beelzebul that I drive devils out, through whom do your own experts drive them out? They shall be your judges, then.</p>

<p>[27]Nanjye niba ari Belizebuli umpa kwirukana abadayimoni, abana banyu ni nde ubaha kubirukana? Ni cyo gituma ari bo babacira urubanza.</p>

<p>[28]But if it is through the Spirit of God that I drive out devils, then be sure that the kingdom of God has caught you unawares.</p>

<p>[28]Ariko Umwuka w'Imana niba ari we umpa kwirukana abadayimoni, noneho ubwami bw'Imana buba bubaguye gitumo.</p>

<p>[29]'Or again, how can anyone make his way into a strong man's house and plunder his property unless he has first tied up the strong man? Only then can he plunder his house.</p>

<p>[29]“Umuntu yabasha ate kwinjira mu nzu y'umunyamaboko ngo amusahure ibintu, atabanje kuboha uwo munyamaboko, ko ari bwo yabona uko asahura inzu ye?</p>

<p>[30]'Anyone who is not with me is against me, and anyone who does not gather in with me throws away.</p>

<p>[30]“Uwo tutabana ni umwanzi wanjye, kandi uwo tudateranyiriza hamwe arasandaza.</p>

<p>[31]And so I tell you, every human sin and blasphemy will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</p>

<p>[31]Ni cyo gitumye mbabwira yuko abantu bazababarirwa icyaha cyose n'igitutsi, ariko gutuka Umwuka ni icyaha kitazababarirwa.</p>

<p>[32]And anyone who says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but no one who speaks against the Holy Spirit will be forgiven either in this world or in the next.</p>

<p>[32]Kandi umuntu wese usebya Umwana w'umuntu azababarirwa, ariko usebya Umwuka Wera ntazababarirwa, naho haba mu gihe cya none cyangwa mu gihe kizaza.</p>

<p>[33]'Make a tree sound and its fruit will be sound; make a tree rotten and its fruit will be rotten. For the tree can be told by its fruit.</p>

<p>[33]“Nimwite igiti cyiza n'imbuto zacyo muzite nziza, cyangwa nimwite igiti kibi n'imbuto zacyo muzite mbi, kuko igiti kimenyekanishwa n'imbuto zacyo.</p>

<p>[34]You brood of vipers, how can your speech be good when you are evil? For words flow out of what fills the heart.</p>

<p>[34]Mwa bana b'incira mwe, mwabasha mute kuvuga amagambo meza muri babi? Ibyuzuye mu mutima ni byo akanwa kavuga.</p>

<p>[35]Good people draw good things from their store of goodness; bad people draw bad things from their store of badness.</p>

<p>[35]Umuntu mwiza atanga ibyiza abikuye mu butunzi bwe bwiza, n'umuntu mubi atanga ibibi abikuye mu butunzi bwe bubi.</p>

<p>[36]So I tell you this, that for every unfounded word people utter they will answer on Judgement Day,</p>

<p>[36]“Kandi ndababwira yuko ijambo ry'impfabusa ryose abantu bavuga, bazaribazwa ku munsi w'amateka.</p>

<p>[37]since it is by your words you will be justified, and by your words condemned.'</p>

<p>[37]Amagambo yawe ni yo azagutsindishiriza, kandi n'amagambo yawe ni yo azagutsindisha.”</p>

<p>[38]Then some of the scribes and Pharisees spoke up. 'Master,' they said, 'we should like to see a sign from you.'</p>

<p>[38]Nuko bamwe mu banditsi n'Abafarisayo baramusubiza bati “Mwigisha, turashaka kureba ikimenyetso kiguturukaho.”</p>

<p>[39]He replied, 'It is an evil and unfaithful generation that asks for a sign! The only sign it will be given is the sign of the prophet Jonah.</p>

<p>[39]Na we arabasubiza ati “Abantu b'igihe kibi bishimira ubusambanyi, bashaka ikimenyetso ariko nta kimenyetso bazahabwa, keretse icy'umuhanuzi Yona.</p>

<p>[40]For as Jonah remained in the belly of the sea-monster for three days and three nights, so will the Son of man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.</p>

<p>[40]Nk'uko Yona yamaze iminsi itatu n'amajoro atatu mu nda y'urufi, ni ko n'Umwana w'umuntu azamara iminsi itatu n'amajoro atatu ikuzimu.</p>

<p>[41]On Judgement Day the men of Nineveh will appear against this generation and they will be its condemnation, because when Jonah preached they repented; and look, there is something greater than Jonah here.</p>

<p>[41]Ab'i Nineve bazahagurukana n'ab'iki gihe ku munsi w'amateka, babatsindishe kuko bihannye ubwo bumvaga kwigisha kwa Yona, kandi dore uruta Yona ari hano.</p>

<p>[42]On Judgement Day the Queen of the South will appear against this generation and be its condemnation, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and look, there is something greater than Solomon here.</p>

<p>[42]Umugabekazi w'igihugu cy'i kusi azahagurukana n'ab'iki gihe ku munsi w'amateka abatsindishe, kuko yavanywe ku mpera y'isi no kumva ubwenge bwa Salomo, kandi dore uruta Salomo ari hano.</p>

<p>[43]'When an unclean spirit goes out of someone it wanders through waterless country looking for a place to rest, and cannot find one.</p>

<p>[43]“Dayimoni iyo avuye mu muntu, anyura ahadafite amazi ashaka uburuhukiro akabubura.</p>

<p>[44]Then it says, "I will return to the home I came from." But on arrival, finding it unoccupied, swept and tidied,</p>

<p>[44]Akavuga ati ‘Reka nsubire mu nzu yanjye navuyemo.' Yagerayo agasanga irimo ubusa, ikubuwe, iteguwe.</p>

<p>[45]it then goes off and collects seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and set up house there, and so that person ends up worse off than before. That is what will happen to this wicked generation.'</p>

<p>[45]Ni ko kugenda akazana abandi badayimoni barindwi bamurusha kuba babi, bakinjira bakabamo, ibyo hanyuma by'uwo muntu bikarusha ibya mbere kuba bibi. Ni ko bizaba ku b'iki gihe kibi.”</p>

<p>[46]He was still speaking to the crowds when suddenly his mother and his brothers were standing outside and were anxious to have a word with him.</p>

<p>[46]Akivugana n'abantu, nyina na bene se bari bahagaze hanze, bashaka kuvugana na we.</p>

<p>[47]still speaking to the crowds when suddenly his mother and his brothers were standing outside and were anxious to have a word with him.</p>

<p>[47]Umuntu aramubwira ati “Nyoko na bene so bahagaze hanze barashaka ko muvugana.”</p>

<p>[48]But to the man who told him this Jesus replied, 'Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?'</p>

<p>[48]Na we asubiza ubimubwiye, aramubaza ati “Mama ni nde, na bene data ni bande?”</p>

<p>[49]And stretching out his hand towards his disciples he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers.</p>

<p>[49]Arambura ukuboko agutunga abigishwa be ati “Dore mama na bene data.</p>

<p>[50]Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.'</p>

<p>[50]Umuntu wese ukora ibyo Data wo mu ijuru ashaka, ni we mwene data, ni we mushiki wanjye, ni we mama.”
