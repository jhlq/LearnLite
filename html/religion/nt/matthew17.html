<h1>Matthew 17:1-20,22-27</h1>

<p>Mt 17:1-27</p>

<p>[1]Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves.</p>

<p>[1]Iminsi itandatu ishize, Yesu ajyana Petero na Yakobo na Yohana mwene se, bajyana mu mpinga y'umusozi muremure bonyine.</p>

<p>[2]There in their presence he was transfigured: his face shone like the sun and his clothes became as dazzling as light.</p>

<p>[2]Ahindurirwa imbere yabo, mu maso he harabagirana nk'izuba, imyenda ye yera nk'umucyo.</p>

<p>[3]And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them; they were talking with him.</p>

<p>[3]Maze Mose na Eliya barababonekera bavugana na we.</p>

<p>[4]Then Peter spoke to Jesus. 'Lord,' he said, 'it is wonderful for us to be here; if you want me to, I will make three shelters here, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.'</p>

<p>[4]Petero abwira Yesu ati “Mwami, ni byiza ubwo turi hano. Nushaka ndaca ingando eshatu hano, imwe yawe, indi ya Mose, indi ya Eliya.”</p>

<p>[5]He was still speaking when suddenly a bright cloud covered them with shadow, and suddenly from the cloud there came a voice which said, 'This is my Son, the Beloved; he enjoys my favour. Listen to him.'</p>

<p>[5]Akibivuga igicu kirabakingiriza, ijwi rikivugiramo riti “Nguyu Umwana wanjye nkunda nkamwishimira, mumwumvire.”</p>

<p>[6]When they heard this, the disciples fell on their faces, overcome with fear.</p>

<p>[6]Abigishwa babyumvise bikubita hasi bubamye, baratinya cyane.</p>

<p>[7]But Jesus came up and touched them, saying, 'Stand up, do not be afraid.'</p>

<p>[7]Yesu arabegera abakoraho arababwira ati “Nimuhaguruke mwitinya.”</p>

<p>[8]And when they raised their eyes they saw no one but Jesus.</p>

<p>[8]Bubura amaso ntibagira undi babona, keretse Yesu wenyine.</p>

<p>[9]As they came down from the mountain Jesus gave them this order, 'Tell no one about this vision until the Son of man has risen from the dead.'</p>

<p>[9]Bakimanuka umusozi, Yesu arabihanangiriza ati “Ntihagire umuntu mubwira ibyo mweretswe, kugeza aho Umwana w'umuntu azazukira.”</p>

<p>[10]And the disciples put this question to him, 'Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?'</p>

<p>[10]Abigishwa be baramubaza bati “Ni iki gituma abanditsi bavuga bati ‘Eliya akwiriye kubanza kuza'?”</p>

<p>[11]He replied, 'Elijah is indeed coming, and he will set everything right again;</p>

<p>[11]Arabasubiza ati “Ni ukuri ko Eliya akwiriye kubanza kuza, akagarura byose akabitunganya.</p>

<p>[12]however, I tell you that Elijah has come already and they did not recognise him but treated him as they pleased; and the Son of man will suffer similarly at their hands.'</p>

<p>[12]Ariko ndababwira yuko Eliya yaje ntibamumenya, ahubwo bamugira uko bashaka. N'Umwana w'umuntu ni ko bazamugira.”</p>

<p>[13]Then the disciples understood that he was speaking of John the Baptist.</p>

<p>[13]Nuko abigishwa bamenya yuko ababwiye ibya Yohana Umubatiza.</p>

<p>[14]As they were rejoining the crowd a man came up to him and went down on his knees before him.</p>

<p>[14]Bageze mu bantu, umuntu araza aramwegera, aramupfukamira aramubwira ati</p>

<p>[15]'Lord,' he said, 'take pity on my son: he is demented and in a wretched state; he is always falling into fire and into water.</p>

<p>[15]“Mwami, babarira umuhungu wanjye kuko arwaye igicuri, kiramubabaza cyane kuko kenshi cyane kimutura mu muriro no mu mazi.</p>

<p>[16]I took him to your disciples and they were unable to cure him.'</p>

<p>[16]Namuzaniye abigishwa bawe ntibabasha kumukiza.”</p>

<p>[17]In reply, Jesus said, 'Faithless and perverse generation! How much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.'</p>

<p>[17]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Yemwe bantu b'iki gihe biyobagiza batizera, nzageza he kubana namwe? Nzabihanganira kugeza ryari? Nimumunzanire hano.”</p>

<p>[18]And when Jesus rebuked it the devil came out of the boy, who was cured from that moment.</p>

<p>[18]Yesu aramucyaha, dayimoni amuvamo, umuhungu aherako arakira.</p>

<p>[19]Then the disciples came privately to Jesus. 'Why were we unable to drive it out?' they asked.</p>

<p>[19]Maze abigishwa begera Yesu biherereye bati “Ni iki cyatumye twebwe bitunanira kumwirukana?”</p>

<p>[20]He answered, 'Because you have so little faith. In truth I tell you, if your faith is the size of a mustard seed you will say to this mountain, "Move from here to there," and it will move; nothing will be impossible for you.'</p>

<p>[20]Arabasubiza ati “Ni ukwizera kwanyu guke: ndababwira ukuri yuko mwaba mufite kwizera kungana n'akabuto ka sinapi, mwabwira uyu musozi muti ‘Va hano ujye hirya' wahava, kandi ntakizabananira. [</p>

<p>[21]</p>

<p>[21]Ariko bene uwo ntavanwamo n'ikindi keretse gusenga no kwiyiriza ubusa.]”</p>

<p>[22]When they were together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of man is going to be delivered into the power of men;</p>

<p>[22]Bakigenda i Galilaya, Yesu arababwira ati “Umwana w'umuntu arenda kuzagambanirwa afatwe n'abantu,</p>

<p>[23]they will put him to death, and on the third day he will be raised up again.' And a great sadness came over them.</p>

<p>[23]bazamwica maze ku munsi wa gatatu azurwe.”Barababara cyane.</p>

<p>[24]When they reached Capernaum, the collectors of the half-shekel came to Peter and said, 'Does your master not pay the half-shekel?'</p>

<p>[24]Bagera i Kaperinawumu, abantu basoresha umusoro w'ididarakama baza aho Petero ari baramubaza bati “Mbese umwigisha wanyu ntatanga ididarakama?”</p>

<p>[25]'Yes,' he replied, and went into the house. But before he could speak, Jesus said, 'Simon, what is your opinion? From whom do earthly kings take toll or tribute? From their sons or from foreigners?'</p>

<p>[25]Arabasubiza ati “Arayitanga.”Yinjiye mu nzu, Yesu aramutanguranwa aramubaza ati “Utekereza ute, Simoni? Abami bo mu isi abo baka umusoro n'ihoro ni abahe? Ni abana babo cyangwa ni rubanda?”</p>

<p>[26]And when he replied, 'From foreigners,' Jesus said, 'Well then, the sons are exempt.</p>

<p>[26]Aramusubiza ati “Ni rubanda.”Yesu aramubwira ati “Nuko rero abana bo bibereye mu mudendezo.</p>

<p>[27]However, so that we shall not be the downfall of others, go to the lake and cast a hook; take the first fish that rises, open its mouth and there you will find a shekel; take it and give it to them for me and for yourself.'</p>

<p>[27]Ariko kugira ngo tutababera igisitaza, jya ku nyanja ujugunyemo ururobo, ifi uri bubanze gufata uyende, uyasamure urasangamo sitateri, uyijyane uyibahe ku bwanjye no ku bwawe.”
