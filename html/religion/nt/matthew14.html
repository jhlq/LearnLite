<h1>Matthew 14:1-36</h1>

<p>Mt 14:1-36</p>

<p>[1]At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the reputation of Jesus</p>

<p>[1]Icyo gihe Umwami Herode yumvise inkuru ya Yesu,</p>

<p>[2]and said to his court, 'This is John the Baptist himself; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.'</p>

<p>[2]abwira abagaragu be ati “Uwo ni Yohana Umubatiza wazutse, ni cyo gituma akora ibitangaza.”</p>

<p>[3]Now it was Herod who had arrested John, chained him up and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.</p>

<p>[3]Kuko Herode yari yarafashe Yohana akamuboha, akamushyira mu nzu y'imbohe ku bwa Herodiya wari muka mwene se Filipo,</p>

<p>[4]For John had told him, 'It is against the Law for you to have her.'</p>

<p>[4]kuko Yohana yari yabwiye Herode ati “Amategeko ntiyemera ko umucyura.”</p>

<p>[5]He had wanted to kill him but was afraid of the people, who regarded John as a prophet.</p>

<p>[5]Yifuzaga kumwica ariko atinya abantu, kuko bemeraga ko ari umuhanuzi.</p>

<p>[6]Then, during the celebrations for Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and so delighted Herod</p>

<p>[6]Umunsi wo kwibuka kuvuka kwa Herode usohoye, umukobwa wa Herodiya abyinira imbere y'abararitswe, ashimisha Herode.</p>

<p>[7]that he promised on oath to give her anything she asked.</p>

<p>[7]Ni cyo cyatumye asezerana arahira ko amuha icyo amusaba cyose.</p>

<p>[8]Prompted by her mother she said, 'Give me John the Baptist's head, here, on a dish.'</p>

<p>[8]Na we amaze koshywa na nyina aramubwira ati “Mpa igihanga cya Yohana Umubatiza ku mbehe.”</p>

<p>[9]The king was distressed but, thinking of the oaths he had sworn and of his guests, he ordered it to be given her,</p>

<p>[9]Umwami arababara, ariko ategeka ko bakimuha ku bw'indahiro yarahiriye imbere y'abasangiraga na we,</p>

<p>[10]and sent and had John beheaded in the prison.</p>

<p>[10]atuma mu nzu y'imbohe ngo bace igihanga cya Yohana.</p>

<p>[11]The head was brought in on a dish and given to the girl, who took it to her mother.</p>

<p>[11]Bazana igihanga cye ku mbehe bagiha umukobwa, agishyīra nyina.</p>

<p>[12]John's disciples came and took the body and buried it; then they went off to tell Jesus.</p>

<p>[12]Abigishwa be barazabajyana umurambo, barawuhamba maze bajya kubibwira Yesu.</p>

<p>[13]When Jesus received this news he withdrew by boat to a lonely place where they could be by themselves. But the crowds heard of this and, leaving the towns, went after him on foot.</p>

<p>[13]Yesu abyumvise arahava, agenda mu bwato ajya aho abantu bataba kwiherera. Abantu benshi babyumvise bava mu midugudu baramukurikira, baca iy'ubutaka.</p>

<p>[14]So as he stepped ashore he saw a large crowd; and he took pity on them and healed their sick.</p>

<p>[14]Yomotse abona abantu benshi arabababarira, abakiriza abarwayi.</p>

<p>[15]When evening came, the disciples went to him and said, 'This is a lonely place, and time has slipped by; so send the people away, and they can go to the villages to buy themselves some food.'</p>

<p>[15]Umunsi ukuze, abigishwa be baramwegera bati “Aha ngaha ntihagira abantu none umunsi urakuze, sezerera abantu bajye mu birorero bīhahire ibyokurya.”</p>

<p>[16]Jesus replied, 'There is no need for them to go: give them something to eat yourselves.'</p>

<p>[16]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Ntakibajyanayo, mube ari mwe mubagaburira.”</p>

<p>[17]But they answered, 'All we have with us is five loaves and two fish.'</p>

<p>[17]Baramusubiza bati “Nta cyo dufite hano, keretse imitsima itanu n'ifi ebyiri.”</p>

<p>[18]So he said, 'Bring them here to me.'</p>

<p>[18]Arababwira ati “Nimubinzanire hano.”</p>

<p>[19]He gave orders that the people were to sit down on the grass; then he took the five loaves and the two fish, raised his eyes to heaven and said the blessing. And breaking the loaves he handed them to his disciples, who gave them to the crowds.</p>

<p>[19]Ategeka abantu ko bicara mu byatsi, yenda iyo mitsima itanu n'izo fi ebyiri, arararama areba mu ijuru arabishimira, amanyagura iyo mitsima ayiha abigishwa be, abigishwa bayiha abantu.</p>

<p>[20]They all ate as much as they wanted, and they collected the scraps left over, twelve baskets full.</p>

<p>[20]Bararya bose barahāga, bateranya ubuvungukira bw'imitsima busigaye, bwuzura intonga cumi n'ebyiri.</p>

<p>[21]Now about five thousand men had eaten, to say nothing of women and children.</p>

<p>[21]Abariye bari nk'ibihumbi bitanu, abagore n'abana batabariwemo.</p>

<p>[22]And at once he made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side while he sent the crowds away.</p>

<p>[22]Uwo mwanya ahata abigishwa be ngo bikire mu bwato babanze hakurya, amare gusezerera abantu.</p>

<p>[23]After sending the crowds away he went up into the hills by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,</p>

<p>[23]Amaze kubasezerera aragenda, azamuka umusozi wenyine ajya gusenga. Bwari bugorobye, ari yo wenyine.</p>

<p>[24]while the boat, by now some furlongs from land, was hard pressed by rough waves, for there was a head-wind.</p>

<p>[24]Ariko ubwato bugeze imuhengeri buteraganwa n'umuraba, kuko umuyaga ubaturutse imbere.</p>

<p>[25]In the fourth watch of the night he came towards them, walking on the sea,</p>

<p>[25]Nuko mu nkoko aza aho bari agendesha amaguru hejuru y'inyanja.</p>

<p>[26]and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified. 'It is a ghost,' they said, and cried out in fear.</p>

<p>[26]Ariko abigishwa bamubonye agendesha amaguru hejuru y'inyanja bahagarika imitima, batakishwa n'ubwoba bati “Ni umuzimu.”</p>

<p>[27]But at once Jesus called out to them, saying, 'Courage! It's me! Don't be afraid.'</p>

<p>[27]Ariko uwo mwanya Yesu avugana na bo ati “Nimuhumure ni jyewe, mwitinya.”</p>

<p>[28]It was Peter who answered. 'Lord,' he said, 'if it is you, tell me to come to you across the water.'</p>

<p>[28]Petero aramusubiza ati “Mwami niba ari wowe, untegeke nze aho uri ngendesha amaguru hejuru y'amazi.”</p>

<p>[29]Jesus said, 'Come.' Then Peter got out of the boat and started walking towards Jesus across the water,</p>

<p>[29]Aramusubiza ati “Ngwino.” Petero ava mu bwato, agendesha amaguru hejuru y'amazi ngo asange Yesu.</p>

<p>[30]but then noticing the wind, he took fright and began to sink. 'Lord,' he cried, 'save me!'</p>

<p>[30]Ariko abonye umuyaga ko ari mwinshi aratinya, atangiye kurengerwa arataka ati “Databuja nkiza.”</p>

<p>[31]Jesus put out his hand at once and held him. 'You have so little faith,' he said, 'why did you doubt?'</p>

<p>[31]Uwo mwanya Yesu arambura ukuboko kwe aramufata, aramubwira ati “Yewe ufite kwizera guke we, ni iki gitumye ushidikanya?”</p>

<p>[32]And as they got into the boat the wind dropped.</p>

<p>[32]Baratambuka bajya mu bwato, umuyaga uratuza.</p>

<p>[33]The men in the boat bowed down before him and said, 'Truly, you are the Son of God.'</p>

<p>[33]Abari mu bwato baramupfukamira, baramubwira bati “Ni ukuri uri Umwana w'Imana.”</p>

<p>[34]Having made the crossing, they came to land at Gennesaret.</p>

<p>[34]Nuko bamaze gufata hakurya, bagera imusozi mu gihugu cy'i Genesareti.</p>

<p>[35]When the local people recognised him they spread the news through the whole neighbourhood and took all that were sick to him,</p>

<p>[35]Ab'aho baramumenya, batuma muri icyo gihugu cyose bamuzanira abarwayi bose,</p>

<p>[36]begging him just to let them touch the fringe of his cloak. And all those who touched it were saved.</p>

<p>[36]baramwinginga ngo bakore ku nshunda z'umwenda we gusa, abazikozeho bose barakira.
