<h1>Matthew 22:1-46</h1>

<p>Mt 22:1-46</p>

<p>[1]Jesus began to speak to them in parables once again,</p>

<p>[1]Yesu yongera kuvugana na bo abacira imigani ati</p>

<p>[2]'The kingdom of Heaven may be compared to a king who gave a feast for his son's wedding.</p>

<p>[2]“Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'umwami wacyujije ubukwe bw'umwana we arongora,</p>

<p>[3]He sent his servants to call those who had been invited, but they would not come.</p>

<p>[3]atuma abagaragu be guhamagara abatorewe gutaha ubukwe, banga kuza.</p>

<p>[4]Next he sent some more servants with the words, "Tell those who have been invited: Look, my banquet is all prepared, my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, everything is ready. Come to the wedding."</p>

<p>[4]Arongera atuma abandi bagaragu ati ‘Mubwire abatowe muti: Dore niteguye amazimano, amapfizi yanjye n'inka zibyibushye babibāze, byose byiteguwe, muze mu bukwe.'</p>

<p>[5]But they were not interested: one went off to his farm, another to his business,</p>

<p>[5]“Maze abo ntibabyitaho barigendera, umwe ajya mu gikingi cye, undi ajya mu rutundo rwe,</p>

<p>[6]and the rest seized his servants, maltreated them and killed them.</p>

<p>[6]abasigaye bafata abagaragu be barabashinyagurira, barabica.</p>

<p>[7]The king was furious. He despatched his troops, destroyed those murderers and burnt their town.</p>

<p>[7]Maze umwami ararakara agaba ingabo ze, arimbura abo bicanyi atwika umudugudu wabo.</p>

<p>[8]Then he said to his servants, "The wedding is ready; but as those who were invited proved to be unworthy,</p>

<p>[8]Maze abwira abagaragu be ati ‘Ubukwe bwiteguwe, ariko abari babutorewe ntibari babukwiriye.</p>

<p>[9]go to the main crossroads and invite everyone you can find to come to the wedding."</p>

<p>[9]Nuko mujye mu nzira nyabagendwa, abo muri buboneyo bose mubahamagare baze batahe ubukwe.'</p>

<p>[10]So these servants went out onto the roads and collected together everyone they could find, bad and good alike; and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</p>

<p>[10]Abo bagaragu barasohoka bajya mu nzira, bateranya abo babonye bose, ababi n'abeza, inzu yo gucyurizamo ubukwe yuzura abasangwa.</p>

<p>[11]When the king came in to look at the guests he noticed one man who was not wearing a wedding garment,</p>

<p>[11]“Umwami yinjiye kureba abasangwa, abonamo umuntu utambaye umwenda w'ubukwe.</p>

<p>[12]and said to him, "How did you get in here, my friend, without a wedding garment?" And the man was silent.</p>

<p>[12]Aramubaza ati ‘Mugenzi wanjye, ni iki gitumye winjira hano utambaye umwenda w'ubukwe?' Na we arahora rwose.</p>

<p>[13]Then the king said to the attendants, "Bind him hand and foot and throw him into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."</p>

<p>[13]Maze umwami abwira abagaragu be ati ‘Nimumubohe amaboko n'amaguru, mumujugunye mu mwijima hanze, ni ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo',</p>

<p>[14]For many are invited but not all are chosen.'</p>

<p>[14]kuko abatowe ari benshi, ariko abatoranyijwe bakaba bake.”</p>

<p>[15]Then the Pharisees went away to work out between them how to trap him in what he said.</p>

<p>[15]Maze Abafarisayo baragenda bajya inama y'uko bari bumutegeshe amagambo.</p>

<p>[16]And they sent their disciples to him, together with some Herodians, to say, 'Master, we know that you are an honest man and teach the way of God in all honesty, and that you are not afraid of anyone, because human rank means nothing to you.</p>

<p>[16]Bamutumaho abigishwa babo hamwe n'Abaherode bati “Mwigisha, tuzi yuko uri inyangamugayo kandi ko wigisha inzira y'Imana by'ukuri, nturobanura abantu ku butoni, kuko utita ku cyubahiro cy'umuntu wese.</p>

<p>[17]Give us your opinion, then. Is it permissible to pay taxes to Caesar or not?'</p>

<p>[17]Nuko tubwire, utekereza ute? Amategeko yemera ko duha Kayisari umusoro, cyangwa ntiyemera?”</p>

<p>[18]But Jesus was aware of their malice and replied, 'You hypocrites! Why are you putting me to the test?</p>

<p>[18]Ariko Yesu amenya uburiganya bwabo, arababaza ati “Mungeragereje iki, mwa ndyarya mwe?</p>

<p>[19]Show me the money you pay the tax with.' They handed him a denarius,</p>

<p>[19]Nimunyereke ifeza y'umusoro.”Bamuzanira idenariyo.</p>

<p>[20]and he said, 'Whose portrait is this? Whose title?'</p>

<p>[20]Arababaza ati “Iyi shusho n'iri zina ni ibya nde?”</p>

<p>[21]They replied, 'Caesar's.' Then he said to them, 'Very well, pay Caesar what belongs to Caesar -- and God what belongs to God.'</p>

<p>[21]Baramusubiza bati “Ni ibya Kayisari.”Maze arababwira ati “Nuko rero ibya Kayisari mubihe Kayisari, iby'Imana mubihe Imana.”</p>

<p>[22]When they heard this they were amazed; they left him alone and went away.</p>

<p>[22]Babyumvise barumirwa, bamusiga aho baragenda.</p>

<p>[23]That day some Sadducees -- who deny that there is a resurrection -- approached him and they put this question to him,</p>

<p>[23]Uwo munsi Abasadukayo bahakanaga yuko ari nta wuzuka, baza aho ari baramubaza bati</p>

<p>[24]'Master, Moses said that if a man dies childless, his brother is to marry the widow, his sister-in-law, to raise children for his brother.</p>

<p>[24]“Mwigisha, Mose yaravuze ngo umuntu napfa batarabyarana, mwene se nahungure umugore we acikure mwene se.</p>

<p>[25]Now we had a case involving seven brothers; the first married and then died without children, leaving his wife to his brother;</p>

<p>[25]Nuko iwacu habayeho abavandimwe barindwi, uwa mbere yararongoye arapfa, maze kuko batabyaranye araga mwene se umugore we.</p>

<p>[26]the same thing happened with the second and third and so on to the seventh,</p>

<p>[26]Nuko n'uwa kabiri n'uwa gatatu kugeza kuri bose uko ari barindwi bamera batyo.</p>

<p>[27]and then last of all the woman herself died.</p>

<p>[27]Hanyuma wa mugore na we arapfa.</p>

<p>[28]Now at the resurrection, whose wife among the seven will she be, since she had been married to them all?'</p>

<p>[28]Mbese mu izuka, azaba ari muka nde muri bose uko ari barindwi, ko bose bari bamufite?”</p>

<p>[29]Jesus answered them, 'You are wrong, because you understand neither the scriptures nor the power of God.</p>

<p>[29]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Mwarahabye kuko mutamenye ibyanditswe cyangwa imbaraga z'Imana.</p>

<p>[30]For at the resurrection men and women do not marry; no, they are like the angels in heaven.</p>

<p>[30]Mu izuka ntibarongora kandi ntibashyingirwa, ahubwo bamera nk'abamarayika bo mu ijuru.</p>

<p>[31]And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you never read what God himself said to you:</p>

<p>[31]Ariko se ibyerekeye ku kuzuka kw'abapfuye, ntimwari mwasoma icyo Imana yababwiye ngo</p>

<p>[32]I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? He is God, not of the dead, but of the living.'</p>

<p>[32]‘Ni jye Mana ya Aburahamu n'Imana ya Isaka n'Imana ya Yakobo?' Imana si Imana y'abapfuye, ahubwo ni iy'abazima.”</p>

<p>[33]And his teaching made a deep impression on the people who heard it.</p>

<p>[33]Abantu babyumvise batangazwa no kwigisha kwe.</p>

<p>[34]But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees they got together</p>

<p>[34]Ariko Abafarisayo bumvise yuko yatsinze Abasadukayo, bakananirwa kumusubiza, bateranira hamwe,</p>

<p>[35]and, to put him to the test, one of them put a further question,</p>

<p>[35]umwe muri bo w'umwigishamategeko amubaza amugerageza ati</p>

<p>[36]'Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?'</p>

<p>[36]“Mwigisha, itegeko rikomeye mu mategeko ni irihe?”</p>

<p>[37]Jesus said to him, 'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.</p>

<p>[37]Na we aramusubiza ati “ ‘Ukundishe Uwiteka, Imana yawe umutima wawe wose n'ubugingo bwawe bwose n'ubwenge bwawe bwose.'</p>

<p>[38]This is the greatest and the first commandment.</p>

<p>[38]Iryo ni ryo tegeko rikomeye ry'imbere.</p>

<p>[39]The second resembles it: You must love your neighbour as yourself.</p>

<p>[39]N'irya kabiri rihwanye na ryo ngiri ‘Ukunde mugenzi wawe nk'uko wikunda.'</p>

<p>[40]On these two commandments hang the whole Law, and the Prophets too.'</p>

<p>[40]Muri ayo mategeko yombi, amategeko yose n'ibyahanuwe ni yo yuririraho.”</p>

<p>[41]While the Pharisees were gathered round, Jesus put to them this question,</p>

<p>[41]Abafarisayo bagiteranye, Yesu arababaza ati</p>

<p>[42]'What is your opinion about the Christ? Whose son is he?' They told him, 'David's.'</p>

<p>[42]“Ibya Kristo murabitekereza mute? Ni mwene nde?”Baramusubiza bati “Ni mwene Dawidi.”</p>

<p>[43]He said to them, 'Then how is it that David, moved by the Spirit, calls him Lord, where he says:</p>

<p>[43]Arababaza ati “Nuko rero ni iki cyatumye Dawidi yabwirijwe n'Umwuka amwita umwami we ati</p>

<p>[44]The Lord declared to my Lord, take your seat at my right hand, till I have made your enemies your footstool?</p>

<p>[44]‘Uwiteka yabwiye Umwami wanjye ati:Icara iburyo bwanjye,Ugeze aho nzashyirira abanzi bawe munsi y'ibirenge byawe.'</p>

<p>[45]'If David calls him Lord, how then can he be his son?'</p>

<p>[45]Nuko ubwo Dawidi amwita umwami we, none abasha ate no kuba umwana we?”</p>

<p>[46]No one could think of anything to say in reply, and from that day no one dared to ask him any further questions.</p>

<p>[46]Ntihagira umuntu wabasha kumusubiza ijambo, ndetse uhereye uwo munsi nta muntu watinyutse kongera kugira icyo amubaza.
