<h1>Matthew 27:1-66</h1>

<p>Mt 27:1-66</p>

<p>[1]When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people met in council to bring about the death of Jesus.</p>

<p>[1]Umuseke utambitse, abatambyi bakuru bose n'abakuru b'ubwo bwoko bigīra inama yo kwica Yesu.</p>

<p>[2]They had him bound and led him away to hand him over to Pilate, the governor.</p>

<p>[2]Baramuboha, baramujyana bamushyira umutegeka Pilato.</p>

<p>[3]When he found that Jesus had been condemned, then Judas, his betrayer, was filled with remorse and took the thirty silver pieces back to the chief priests and elders</p>

<p>[3]Maze Yuda wamugambaniye abonye ko urubanza rutsinze Yesu, aricuza asubiza abatambyi bakuru n'abakuru bya bice by'ifeza mirongo itatu ati</p>

<p>[4]saying, 'I have sinned. I have betrayed innocent blood.' They replied, 'What is that to us? That is your concern.'</p>

<p>[4]“Nakoze icyaha, kuko nagambaniye amaraso atariho urubanza.”Ariko bo baramusubiza bati “Biramaze! Ni ibyawe.”</p>

<p>[5]And flinging down the silver pieces in the sanctuary he made off, and went and hanged himself.</p>

<p>[5]Ifeza azijugunya mu rusengero arasohoka, aragenda arimanika.</p>

<p>[6]The chief priests picked up the silver pieces and said, 'It is against the Law to put this into the treasury; it is blood-money.'</p>

<p>[6]Ariko abatambyi bakuru bajyana bya bice by'ifeza baravuga bati “Amategeko ntiyemera ko tubishyira mu bubiko bw'Imana, kuko ari ibiguzi by'amaraso.”</p>

<p>[7]So they discussed the matter and with it bought the potter's field as a graveyard for foreigners,</p>

<p>[7]Bajya inama bazigura isambu y'umubumbyi, ngo ijye ihambwamo abashyitsi.</p>

<p>[8]and this is why the field is still called the Field of Blood.</p>

<p>[8]Ni cyo gituma iyo sambu yitwa Isambu y'amaraso na bugingo n'ubu.</p>

<p>[9]The word spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was then fulfilled: And they took the thirty silver pieces, the sum at which the precious One was priced by the children of Israel,</p>

<p>[9]Ni bwo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yeremiya byasohoye ngo “Bajyanye ibice by'ifeza mirongo itatu, ari cyo giciro cy'uwo baciriye, uwo bamwe mu Bisirayeli baciriye,</p>

<p>[10]and they gave them for the potter's field, just as the Lord directed me.</p>

<p>[10]babigura isambu y'umubumbyi nk'uko Uwiteka yanyeretse.”</p>

<p>[11]Jesus, then, was brought before the governor, and the governor put to him this question, 'Are you the king of the Jews?' Jesus replied, 'It is you who say it.'</p>

<p>[11]Ubwo Yesu yari ahagaze imbere y'umutegeka. Umutegeka aramubaza ati “Ni wowe mwami w'Abayuda?”Yesu aramusubiza ati “Wakabimenye.”</p>

<p>[12]But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders he refused to answer at all.</p>

<p>[12]Abatambyi bakuru n'abakuru baramurega, ariko ntiyagira icyo yireguza na hato.</p>

<p>[13]Pilate then said to him, 'Do you not hear how many charges they have made against you?'</p>

<p>[13]Maze Pilato aramubaza ati “Ntiwumvise ko bagushinje byinshi?”</p>

<p>[14]But to the governor's amazement, he offered not a word in answer to any of the charges.</p>

<p>[14]Ariko ntiyamusubiza ijambo na rimwe, bituma umutegeka yumirwa cyane.</p>

<p>[15]At festival time it was the governor's practice to release a prisoner for the people, anyone they chose.</p>

<p>[15]Muri iyo minsi mikuru, uko umwaka utashye umutegeka yagiraga akamenyero ko kubohorera abantu imbohe imwe, iyo bashakaga.</p>

<p>[16]Now there was then a notorious prisoner whose name was Barabbas.</p>

<p>[16]Icyo gihe bari bafite imbohe y'ikimenywabose, yitwaga Baraba.</p>

<p>[17]So when the crowd gathered, Pilate said to them, 'Which do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?'</p>

<p>[17]Nuko bateranye Pilato arababaza ati “Uwo mushaka ko mbabohorera ni nde? Ni Baraba, cyangwa ni Yesu witwa Kristo?”</p>

<p>[18]For Pilate knew it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over.</p>

<p>[18]Kuko yamenye yuko ishyari ari ryo rimubatangishije.</p>

<p>[19]Now as he was seated in the chair of judgement, his wife sent him a message, 'Have nothing to do with that upright man; I have been extremely upset today by a dream that I had about him.'</p>

<p>[19]Kandi ubwo yari yicaye ku ntebe y'imanza, umugore we amutumaho ati “Ntugire icyo utwara uwo mukiranutsi, kuko naraye ndose byinshi kuri we byambabaje.”</p>

<p>[20]The chief priests and the elders, however, had persuaded the crowd to demand the release of Barabbas and the execution of Jesus.</p>

<p>[20]Ariko abatambyi bakuru n'abakuru boshya abantu ngo basabe Baraba, bicishe Yesu.</p>

<p>[21]So when the governor spoke and asked them, 'Which of the two do you want me to release for you?' they said, 'Barabbas.'</p>

<p>[21]Nuko umutegeka yongera kubabaza ati “Muri abo bombi, uwo mushaka ni nde nkamubabohorera?”Bati “Ni Baraba.”</p>

<p>[22]Pilate said to them, 'But in that case, what am I to do with Jesus who is called Christ?' They all said, 'Let him be crucified!'</p>

<p>[22]Pilato arabasubiza ati “Yesu witwa Kristo ndamugira nte?”Bose bati “Nabambwe!”</p>

<p>[23]He asked, 'But what harm has he done?' But they shouted all the louder, 'Let him be crucified!'</p>

<p>[23]Na we arababaza ati “Kuki? Yakoze cyaha ki?”Ariko barushaho gusakuza cyane bati “Nabambwe!”</p>

<p>[24]Then Pilate saw that he was making no impression, that in fact a riot was imminent. So he took some water, washed his hands in front of the crowd and said, 'I am innocent of this man's blood. It is your concern.'</p>

<p>[24]Nuko Pilato abonye ko arushywa n'ubusa, ahubwo ko barushijeho gushega, yenda amazi akarabira imbere y'abantu ati “Jyeweho nta cyaha kindiho ku bw'amaraso y'uyu mukiranutsi, birabe ibyanyu.”</p>

<p>[25]And the people, every one of them, shouted back, 'Let his blood be on us and on our children!'</p>

<p>[25]Abantu bose baramusubiza bati “Amaraso ye natubeho no ku bana bacu.”</p>

<p>[26]Then he released Barabbas for them. After having Jesus scourged he handed him over to be crucified.</p>

<p>[26]Maze ababohorera Baraba, ariko amaze gukubita Yesu imikoba, aramutanga ngo abambwe.</p>

<p>[27]Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus with them into the Praetorium and collected the whole cohort round him.</p>

<p>[27]Maze abasirikare b'umutegeka bajyana Yesu mu rukiko, bamuteraniranirizaho ingabo zose.</p>

<p>[28]And they stripped him and put a scarlet cloak round him,</p>

<p>[28]Baramucuza, bamwambika umwenda w'umuhemba,</p>

<p>[29]and having twisted some thorns into a crown they put this on his head and placed a reed in his right hand. To make fun of him they knelt to him saying, 'Hail, king of the Jews!'</p>

<p>[29]baboha ikamba ry'amahwa barimwambika mu mutwe, n'urubingo mu kuboko kwe kw'iburyo baramupfukamira, baramushinyagurira bati “Ni amahoro, mwami w'Abayuda!”</p>

<p>[30]And they spat on him and took the reed and struck him on the head with it.</p>

<p>[30]Bamucira amacandwe, benda rwa rubingo barumukubita mu mutwe.</p>

<p>[31]And when they had finished making fun of him, they took off the cloak and dressed him in his own clothes and led him away to crucifixion.</p>

<p>[31]Bamaze kumushinyagurira bamwambura wa mwenda, bamwambika imyenda ye bamujyana kumubamba.</p>

<p>[32]On their way out, they came across a man from Cyrene, called Simon, and enlisted him to carry his cross.</p>

<p>[32]Bagisohoka, bahura n'Umunyakurene witwaga Simoni, uwo bamuhata kujyana na bo ngo yikorere umusaraba wa Yesu.</p>

<p>[33]When they had reached a place called Golgotha, that is, the place of the skull,</p>

<p>[33]Bageze ahitwa i Gologota, hasobanurwa ngo i Nyabihanga,</p>

<p>[34]they gave him wine to drink mixed with gall, which he tasted but refused to drink.</p>

<p>[34]bamuha vino ivanze n'indurwe ngo anywe, asogongeye yanga kuyinywa.</p>

<p>[35]When they had finished crucifying him they shared out his clothing by casting lots,</p>

<p>[35]Bamaze kumubamba, bagabana imyenda ye, barayifindira,</p>

<p>[36]and then sat down and stayed there keeping guard over him.</p>

<p>[36]bicara aho baramurinda.</p>

<p>[37]Above his head was placed the charge against him; it read: 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.'</p>

<p>[37]Bashyira hejuru y'umutwe we ibirego bamureze, byanditswe ngo “UYU NI YESU, UMWAMI W'ABAYUDA.”</p>

<p>[38]Then two bandits were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.</p>

<p>[38]Maze abambuzi babiri bababambana na we, umwe iburyo bwe undi ibumoso.</p>

<p>[39]The passers-by jeered at him; they shook their heads</p>

<p>[39]Abahisi baramutuka, bamuzunguriza imitwe</p>

<p>[40]and said, 'So you would destroy the Temple and in three days rebuild it! Then save yourself if you are God's son and come down from the cross!'</p>

<p>[40]baravuga bati “Wowe usenya urusengero ukarwubaka mu minsi itatu, ikize. Niba uri Umwana w'Imana, manuka uve ku musaraba.”</p>

<p>[41]The chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked him in the same way,</p>

<p>[41]Abatambyi bakuru n'abanditsi n'abakuru na bo bashinyagura batyo bati</p>

<p>[42]with the words, 'He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the king of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.</p>

<p>[42]“Yakijije abandi, ntabasha kwikiza. Ko ari umwami w'Abisirayeli, namanuke ave ku musaraba nonaha, natwe turamwemera.</p>

<p>[43]He has put his trust in God; now let God rescue him if he wants him. For he did say, "I am God's son." '</p>

<p>[43]Yiringiye Imana, ngaho nimukize nonaha, niba imukunda kuko yavuze ati ‘Ndi Umwana w'Imana.' ”</p>

<p>[44]Even the bandits who were crucified with him taunted him in the same way.</p>

<p>[44]N'abambuzi babambanywe na we, na bo bamutuka batyo.</p>

<p>[45]From the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</p>

<p>[45]Uhereye ku isaha ya gatandatu haba ubwirakabiri mu gihugu cyose kugeza ku isaha ya cyenda.</p>

<p>[46]And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?' that is, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'</p>

<p>[46]Maze ku isaha ya cyenda Yesu avuga ijwi rirenga ati “Eli, Eli, lama sabakitani?” Bisobanurwa ngo “Mana yanjye, Mana yanjye, ni iki kikundekesheje?”</p>

<p>[47]When some of those who stood there heard this, they said, 'The man is calling on Elijah,'</p>

<p>[47]Ariko bamwe mu bari bahagaze aho babyumvise baravuga bati “Umva wa mugabo arahamagara Eliya.”</p>

<p>[48]and one of them quickly ran to get a sponge which he filled with vinegar and, putting it on a reed, gave it him to drink.</p>

<p>[48]Uwo mwanya umwe muri bo arirukanka, yenda sipongo ayuzuza inzoga isharira, ayishyira ku rubingo arayimushomesha.</p>

<p>[49]But the rest of them said, 'Wait! And see if Elijah will come to save him.'</p>

<p>[49]Ariko abandi bati “Ba uretse turebe ko Eliya aza kumukiza.”</p>

<p>[50]But Jesus, again crying out in a loud voice, yielded up his spirit.</p>

<p>[50]Ariko Yesu yongera kuvuga ijwi rirenga, aratanga.</p>

<p>[51]And suddenly, the veil of the Sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth quaked, the rocks were split,</p>

<p>[51]Umwenda ukingiriza Ahera cyane h'urusengero utabukamo kabiri, utangirira hejuru ugeza hasi, isi iratigita, ibitare birameneka,</p>

<p>[52]the tombs opened and the bodies of many holy people rose from the dead,</p>

<p>[52]ibituro birakinguka, intumbi nyinshi z'abera bari barasinziriye zirazurwa,</p>

<p>[53]and these, after his resurrection, came out of the tombs, entered the holy city and appeared to a number of people.</p>

<p>[53]bava mu bituro, maze amaze kuzuka binjira mu murwa wera, babonekera benshi.</p>

<p>[54]The centurion, together with the others guarding Jesus, had seen the earthquake and all that was taking place, and they were terrified and said, 'In truth this man was son of God.'</p>

<p>[54]Umutware utwara umutwe w'abasirikare n'abari kumwe na we barinda Yesu, babonye igishyitsi n'ibibaye baratinya cyane bati “Ni ukuri, uyu yari Umwana w'Imana.”</p>

<p>[55]And many women were there, watching from a distance, the same women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and looked after him.</p>

<p>[55]Hariho n'abagore benshi bari bahagaze kure bareba, ni bo bakurikiye Yesu ava i Galilaya, baramukorera.</p>

<p>[56]Among them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</p>

<p>[56]Muri bo harimo Mariya Magadalena, na Mariya nyina wa Yakobo na Yosefu, na nyina wa bene Zebedayo.</p>

<p>[57]When it was evening, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, called Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.</p>

<p>[57]Nuko nimugoroba haza umuntu w'umutunzi wo muri Arimataya witwaga Yosefu, kandi na we yari umwigishwa wa Yesu.</p>

<p>[58]This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be handed over.</p>

<p>[58]Uwo ajya kwa Pilato asaba intumbi ya Yesu, maze Pilato ategeka ko bayimuha.</p>

<p>[59]So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean shroud</p>

<p>[59]Yosefu ajyana intumbi, ayizingira mu mwenda w'igitare wera,</p>

<p>[60]and put it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock. He then rolled a large stone across the entrance of the tomb and went away.</p>

<p>[60]ayishyira mu mva ye nshya, iyo yakorogoshoye mu rutare, abirindurira igitare ku munwa w'imva, aragenda.</p>

<p>[61]Now Mary of Magdala and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the sepulchre.</p>

<p>[61]Mariya Magadalena na Mariya wundi bari bahari bicaye berekeye imva.</p>

<p>[62]Next day, that is, when Preparation Day was over, the chief priests and the Pharisees went in a body to Pilate</p>

<p>[62]Nuko bukeye bwaho, ari wo munsi wakurikiraga uwo Kwitegura, abatambyi bakuru n'Abafarisayo bateranira kwa Pilato.</p>

<p>[63]and said to him, 'Your Excellency, we recall that this impostor said, while he was still alive, "After three days I shall rise again."</p>

<p>[63]Baramubwira bati “Mutware, twibutse yuko wa mubeshyi akiri muzima yagize ngo iminsi itatu nishira azazuka.</p>

<p>[64]Therefore give the order to have the sepulchre kept secure until the third day, for fear his disciples come and steal him away and tell the people, "He has risen from the dead." This last piece of fraud would be worse than what went before.'</p>

<p>[64]Nuko tegeka barinde igituro cyane bazageze ku munsi wa gatatu, kugira ngo abigishwa be bataza kumwiba bakabwira abantu ngo arazutse, maze kuyoba kwa nyuma kukaruta ukwa mbere.”</p>

<p>[65]Pilate said to them, 'You may have your guard; go and make all as secure as you know how.'</p>

<p>[65]Pilato arababwira ati “Ngaba abarinzi, nimugende mukirindishe uko mubizi.”</p>

<p>[66]So they went and made the sepulchre secure, putting seals on the stone and mounting a guard.</p>

<p>[66]Na bo baragenda barindisha igituro, bahoma ubushishi ku gitare kugira ngo bagiteranye n'umunwa w'igituro, babushyiraho ikimenyetso abarinzi bahari.
