<h1>Matthew 8:1-34</h1>

<p>Mt 8:1-34</p>

<p>[1]After he had come down from the mountain large crowds followed him.</p>

<p>[1]Amanutse kuri uwo musozi, abantu benshi baramukurikira.</p>

<p>[2]Suddenly a man with a virulent skin-disease came up and bowed low in front of him, saying, 'Lord, if you are willing, you can cleanse me.'</p>

<p>[2]Maze haza umubembe aramwegera, aramupfukamira aramubwira ati “Mwami, washaka wabasha kunkiza.”</p>

<p>[3]Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him saying, 'I am willing. Be cleansed.' And his skin-disease was cleansed at once.</p>

<p>[3]Arambura ukuboko amukoraho ati “Ndabishaka kira.”</p>

<p>[4]Then Jesus said to him, 'Mind you tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest and make the offering prescribed by Moses, as evidence to them.'</p>

<p>[4]Uwo mwanya ibibembe bye birakira. Yesu aramubwira ati “Wirinde ntugire uwo ubwira, ahubwo genda wiyereke umutambyi, uture n'ituro Mose yategetse ribabere ikimenyetso cyo kubahamiriza.”</p>

<p>[5]When he went into Capernaum a centurion came up and pleaded with him.</p>

<p>[5]Ageze i Kaperinawumu, haza umutware utwara umutwe w'abasirikare aramwinginga ati</p>

<p>[6]'Sir,' he said, 'my servant is lying at home paralysed and in great pain.'</p>

<p>[6]“Mwami, umugaragu wanjye aryamye mu nzu yararemaye, arababaye cyane.”</p>

<p>[7]Jesus said to him, 'I will come myself and cure him.'</p>

<p>[7]Aramubwira ati “Ndaza mukize.”</p>

<p>[8]The centurion replied, 'Sir, I am not worthy to have you under my roof; just give the word and my servant will be cured.</p>

<p>[8]Umutware w'abasirikare aramusubiza ati “Mwami, ntibinkwiriye yuko winjira mu nzu yanjye, ahubwo tegeka gusa, umugaragu wanjye arakira.</p>

<p>[9]For I am under authority myself and have soldiers under me; and I say to one man, "Go," and he goes; to another, "Come here," and he comes; to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.'</p>

<p>[9]Kuko nanjye ndi umuntu utwarwa n'abandi, mfite abasirikare ntwara. Iyo mbwiye umwe nti ‘Genda' aragenda, nabwira undi nti ‘Ngwino' akaza, nabwira umugaragu wanjye nti ‘Kora iki' akagikora.”</p>

<p>[10]When Jesus heard this he was astonished and said to those following him, 'In truth I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found faith as great as this.</p>

<p>[10]Yesu abyumvise aratangara, abwira abamukurikiye ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko ntabwo nari nabona kwizera kungana gutya, habe no mu Bisirayeli.</p>

<p>[11]And I tell you that many will come from east and west and sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob at the feast in the kingdom of Heaven;</p>

<p>[11]Ndababwira yuko benshi bazaturuka iburasirazuba n'iburengerazuba, bakicarana na Aburahamu na Isaka na Yakobo mu bwami bwo mu ijuru,</p>

<p>[12]but the children of the kingdom will be thrown out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.'</p>

<p>[12]ariko abana bo muri burya bwami bazirukanirwa mu mwijima hanze, ari ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo.”</p>

<p>[13]And to the centurion Jesus said, 'Go back, then; let this be done for you, as your faith demands.' And the servant was cured at that moment.</p>

<p>[13]Yesu abwira uwo mutware ati “Nuko genda bikubere nk'uko wizeye.”Umugaragu we akira uwo mwanya.</p>

<p>[14]And going into Peter's house Jesus found Peter's mother-in-law in bed and feverish.</p>

<p>[14]Yesu ajya mu nzu ya Petero, abona nyirabukwe aryamye arwaye ubuganga,</p>

<p>[15]He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.</p>

<p>[15]amukora ku kuboko ubuganga bumuvamo, arabyuka aramugaburira.</p>

<p>[16]That evening they brought him many who were possessed by devils. He drove out the spirits with a command and cured all who were sick.</p>

<p>[16]Nimugoroba bamuzanira abantu benshi batewe n'abadayimoni, yirukanisha abadayimoni itegeko gusa, akiza abari barwaye bose,</p>

<p>[17]This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: He himself bore our sicknesses away and carried our diseases.</p>

<p>[17]kugira ngo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yesaya bisohore ngo “Ubwe ni we watwaraga ubumuga bwacu, akikorera n'indwara zacu.”</p>

<p>[18]When Jesus saw the crowd all about him he gave orders to leave for the other side.</p>

<p>[18]Kandi Yesu abonye abantu benshi bamugose, ategeka ko bambuka bakajya hakurya.</p>

<p>[19]One of the scribes then came up and said to him, 'Master, I will follow you wherever you go.'</p>

<p>[19]Umwe mu banditsi araza aramubwira ati “Mwigisha, ndagukurikira aho ujya hose.”</p>

<p>[20]Jesus said, 'Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.'</p>

<p>[20]Yesu aramubwira ati “Ingunzu zifite imyobo n'ibiguruka mu kirere bifite ibyari, ariko Umwana w'umuntu ntafite aho kurambika umusaya.”</p>

<p>[21]Another man, one of the disciples, said to him, 'Lord, let me go and bury my father first.'</p>

<p>[21]Undi wo mu bigishwa be aramubwira ati “Databuja, banza undeke ngende mpambe data.”</p>

<p>[22]But Jesus said, 'Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.'</p>

<p>[22]Yesu arambwira ati “Nkurikira, reka abapfuye bihambire abapfuye babo.”</p>

<p>[23]Then he got into the boat followed by his disciples.</p>

<p>[23]Yikira mu bwato, abigishwa be bajyana na we.</p>

<p>[24]Suddenly a storm broke over the lake, so violent that the boat was being swamped by the waves. But he was asleep.</p>

<p>[24]Umuyaga uba mwinshi mu nyanja, ubwato bwabo burengerwa n'umuraba wisuka muri bwo, ariko we yari asinziriye.</p>

<p>[25]So they went to him and woke him saying, 'Save us, Lord, we are lost!'</p>

<p>[25]Baraza baramukangura bati “Databuja, dukize turapfuye.”</p>

<p>[26]And he said to them, 'Why are you so frightened, you who have so little faith?' And then he stood up and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</p>

<p>[26]Arababaza ati “Ni iki kibateye ubwoba, mwa bafite kwizera guke mwe?” Maze arabyuka acyaha umuyaga n'inyanja, biratuza rwose.</p>

<p>[27]They were astounded and said, 'Whatever kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?'</p>

<p>[27]Abantu baratangara bati “Uyu ni muntu ki? Umuyaga n'inyanja na byo biramwumvira!”</p>

<p>[28]When he reached the territory of the Gadarenes on the other side, two demoniacs came towards him out of the tombs -- they were so dangerously violent that nobody could use that path.</p>

<p>[28]Amaze gufata hakurya mu gihugu cy'Abagadareni, ahura n'abantu babiri batewe n'abadayimoni bava mu mva, bari abasazi cyane bituma ari nta watinyuka kunyura muri iyo nzira.</p>

<p>[29]Suddenly they shouted, 'What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before the time?'</p>

<p>[29]Barataka cyane bati “Duhuriye he, Mwana w'Imana? Mbese uje hano kutwica urupfu n'agashinyaguro, igihe cyacu kitaragera?”</p>

<p>[30]Now some distance away there was a large herd of pigs feeding,</p>

<p>[30]Hirya yabo hari umugana w'ingurube nyinshi zirisha.</p>

<p>[31]and the devils pleaded with Jesus, 'If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.'</p>

<p>[31]Abadayimoni bazibonye baramwinginga bati “Nutwirukana utwohereze muri uriya mugana w'ingurube.”</p>

<p>[32]And he said to them, 'Go then,' and they came out and made for the pigs; and at that the whole herd charged down the cliff into the lake and perished in the water.</p>

<p>[32]Arabasubiza ati “Nimugende.” Babavamo baragenda, bajya muri izo ngurube. Umugana wose wirukira ku gacuri, zisuka mu nyanja zipfira mu mazi.</p>

<p>[33]The herdsmen ran off and made for the city, where they told the whole story, including what had happened to the demoniacs.</p>

<p>[33]Abungeri bazo barahunga, binjiye mu mudugudu bavuga ibyo babonye byose, n'iby'abari batewe n'abadayimoni.</p>

<p>[34]Suddenly the whole city set out to meet Jesus; and as soon as they saw him they implored him to leave their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>[34]Abo muri uwo mudugudu bose bajya gusanganira Yesu, bamubonye baramwinginga ngo ave mu gihugu cyabo.
