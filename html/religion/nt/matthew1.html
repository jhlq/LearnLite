<p>[18]This is how Jesus Christ came to be born. His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph; but before they came to live together she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>[18]Kuvuka kwa Yesu Kristo kwagenze gutya. Nyina Mariya yari yarasabwe na Yosefu, ariko yari ataramurongora, babona afite inda y'Umwuka Wera.</p>

<p>[19]Her husband Joseph, being an upright man and wanting to spare her disgrace, decided to divorce her informally.</p>

<p>[19]Umugabo we Yosefu kuko yari umukiranutsi kandi adashaka kumukoza isoni ku mugaragaro, yigira inama yo kumubenga rwihishwa.</p>

<p>[20]He had made up his mind to do this when suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, 'Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because she has conceived what is in her by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>[20]Akibitekereza, marayika w'Umwami Imana amubonekera mu nzozi ati “Yosefu mwene Dawidi, witinya kurongora umugeni wawe Mariya, kuko imbuto imurimo ari iy'Umwuka Wera.</p>

<p>[21]She will give birth to a son and you must name him Jesus, because he is the one who is to save his people from their sins.'</p>

<p>[21]Azabyara umuhungu uzamwite YESU, kuko ari we uzakiza abantu be ibyaha byabo.”</p>

<p>[22]Now all this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:</p>

<p>[22]Nuko ibyo byose byabereyeho kugira ngo ibyo Umwami Imana yavugiye mu kanwa k'umuhanuzi bisohore ngo</p>

<p>[23]Look! the virgin is with child and will give birth to a son whom they will call Immanuel, a name which means 'God-is-with-us'.</p>

<p>[23]“Dore umwari azasama inda kandi azabyara umuhungu,Azitwa Imanweli”,risobanurwa ngo “Imana iri kumwe natwe”.</p>

<p>[24]When Joseph woke up he did what the angel of the Lord had told him to do: he took his wife to his home;</p>

<p>[24]Yosefu akangutse abigenza uko marayika w'Umwami Imana yamutegetse, arongora umugeni we.</p>

<p>[25]he had not had intercourse with her when she gave birth to a son; and he named him Jesus.</p>

<p>[25]Ariko ntibaryamana arinda ageza igihe yabyariye umuhungu, amwita YESU.
