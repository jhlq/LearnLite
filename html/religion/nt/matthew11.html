<h1>Matthew 11:1-30</h1>

<p>Mt 11:1-30</p>

<p>[1]When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he moved on from there to teach and preach in their towns.</p>

<p>[1]Yesu amaze gutegeka abigishwa be cumi na babiri, avayo ajya kwigisha no kubwiriza abantu mu midugudu y'aho.</p>

<p>[2]Now John had heard in prison what Christ was doing and he sent his disciples to ask him,</p>

<p>[2]Ariko Yohana yumviye mu nzu y'imbohe ibyo Yesu akora, atuma abigishwa be ko bamubaza bati</p>

<p>[3]'Are you the one who is to come, or are we to expect someone else?'</p>

<p>[3]“Mbese ni wowe wa wundi ukwiriye kuza, cyangwa dutegereze undi?”</p>

<p>[4]Jesus answered, 'Go back and tell John what you hear and see;</p>

<p>[4]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Nimugende mubwire Yohana ibyo mwumvise n'ibyo mubonye.</p>

<p>[5]the blind see again, and the lame walk, those suffering from virulent skin-diseases are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life and the good news is proclaimed to the poor;</p>

<p>[5]Impumyi zirahumuka, ibirema biragenda, ababembe barakira, ibipfamatwi birumva, abapfuye barazurwa, abakene barabwirwa ubutumwa bwiza.</p>

<p>[6]and blessed is anyone who does not find me a cause of falling.'</p>

<p>[6]Kandi hahirwa uwo ibyanjye bitazagusha.”</p>

<p>[7]As the men were leaving, Jesus began to talk to the people about John, 'What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swaying in the breeze? No?</p>

<p>[7]Abo bakigenda, Yesu atangira kuvugana n'abantu ibya Yohana ati “Mwagiye mu butayu kureba iki? Urubingo ruhungabanywa n'umuyaga?</p>

<p>[8]Then what did you go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothes are to be found in palaces.</p>

<p>[8]Ariko mwagiye kureba iki? Umuntu wambaye imyenda yorohereye? Erega abambara iyorohereye baba mu ngo z'abami!</p>

<p>[9]Then what did you go out for? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet:</p>

<p>[9]Ariko mwajyanywe n'iki? Kureba umuhanuzi? Ni koko, kandi ndababwira yuko aruta umuhanuzi cyane.</p>

<p>[10]he is the one of whom scripture says: Look, I am going to send my messenger in front of you to prepare your way before you.</p>

<p>[10]Uwo ni we wandikiwe ngo‘Dore ndenda gutuma integuza yanjye mbere yawe,Izakubanziriza igutunganirize inzira.'</p>

<p>[11]'In truth I tell you, of all the children born to women, there has never been anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.</p>

<p>[11]“Ndababwira ukuri, yuko mu babyawe n'abagore hatigeze kubaho umuntu uruta Yohana Umubatiza, ariko umuto mu bwami bwo mu ijuru aramuruta.</p>

<p>[12]Since John the Baptist came, up to this present time, the kingdom of Heaven has been subjected to violence and the violent are taking it by storm.</p>

<p>[12]Uhereye ku gihe cya Yohana Umubatiza ukageza none, ubwami bwo mu ijuru buratwaranirwa, intwarane zibugishamo imbaraga.</p>

<p>[13]Because it was towards John that all the prophecies of the prophets and of the Law were leading;</p>

<p>[13]Kuko abahanuzi bose n'amategeko byahanuye kugeza igihe cya Yohana,</p>

<p>[14]and he, if you will believe me, is the Elijah who was to return.</p>

<p>[14]kandi niba mushaka kubyemera, ni we Eliya wahanuwe ko azaza.</p>

<p>[15]Anyone who has ears should listen!</p>

<p>[15]Ufite amatwi yumva niyumve.</p>

<p>[16]'What comparison can I find for this generation? It is like children shouting to each other as they sit in the market place:</p>

<p>[16]“Ariko ab'iki gihe ndabagereranya n'iki? Bameze nk'abana bato bicaye mu maguriro bahamagara bagenzi babo bati</p>

<p>[17]We played the pipes for you, and you wouldn't dance; we sang dirges, and you wouldn't be mourners.</p>

<p>[17]‘Twabavugirije imyironge ntimwabyina, twaboroze ntimwarira.'</p>

<p>[18]'For John came, neither eating nor drinking, and they say, "He is possessed."</p>

<p>[18]Kuko Yohana yaje atarya atanywa, bagira bati ‘Afite dayimoni.'</p>

<p>[19]The Son of man came, eating and drinking, and they say, "Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners." Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.'</p>

<p>[19]Umwana w'umuntu aje arya anywa, bagira bati ‘Dore iki kirura cy'umunywi w'inzoga, incuti y'abakoresha b'ikoro n'abanyabyaha.' Ariko ubwenge bwerekanwa n'imirimo yabwo.”</p>

<p>[20]Then he began to reproach the towns in which most of his miracles had been worked, because they refused to repent.</p>

<p>[20]Maze atangiriraho gucyaha imidugudu, iyo yakoreyemo ibitangaza byinshi, kuko batihannye.</p>

<p>[21]'Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</p>

<p>[21]Ati “Korazini, uzabona ishyano! Betsayida, uzabona ishyano! Kuko ibitangaza byakorewe muri mwe, iyaba byarakorewe muri Tiro n'i Sidoni baba barihannye kera, bakambara ibigunira, bakisīga ivu.</p>

<p>[22]Still, I tell you that it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on Judgement Day than for you.</p>

<p>[22]Ariko ndababwira yuko ku munsi w'amateka, i Tiro n'i Sidoni hazahanwa igihano cyakwihanganirwa kuruta icyanyu.</p>

<p>[23]And as for you, Capernaum, did you want to be raised as high as heaven? You shall be flung down to hell. For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been standing yet.</p>

<p>[23]Nawe Kaperinawumu, ushyizwe hejuru ndetse ugeze ku ijuru. Ariko uzamanuka ikuzimu, kuko ibitangaza byakorewe muri wowe iyaba byarakorewe muri Sodomu, iba ikiriho na none.</p>

<p>[24]Still, I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on Judgement Day than for you.'</p>

<p>[24]Ariko ndababwira yuko ku munsi w'amateka, igihugu cy'i Sodomu kizahanwa igihano cyakwihanganirwa kuruta icyanyu.”</p>

<p>[25]At that time Jesus exclaimed, 'I bless you, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, for hiding these things from the learned and the clever and revealing them to little children.</p>

<p>[25]Muri iyo minsi Yesu aravuga ati “Ndagushima Data, Mwami w'ijuru n'isi, kuko wahishe ibyo abanyabwenge n'abahanga, ukabimenyesha abana bato.</p>

<p>[26]Yes, Father, for that is what it pleased you to do.</p>

<p>[26]Ni koko Data, kuko ari ko wabishatse.</p>

<p>[27]Everything has been entrusted to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, just as no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</p>

<p>[27]“Byose nabihawe na Data, kandi nta wuzi Umwana w'Imana keretse Se, kandi nta wuzi Se keretse Umwana w'Imana, n'umuntu wese uwo Mwana ashatse kuyimenyesha.</p>

<p>[28]'Come to me, all you who labour and are overburdened, and I will give you rest.</p>

<p>[28]“Mwese abarushye n'abaremerewe, nimuze munsange ndabaruhura.</p>

<p>[29]Shoulder my yoke and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</p>

<p>[29]Mwemere kuba abagaragu banjye munyigireho, kuko ndi umugwaneza kandi noroheje mu mutima, namwe muzabona uburuhukiro mu mitima yanyu,</p>

<p>[30]Yes, my yoke is easy and my burden light.'</p>

<p>[30]kuko kunkorera kutaruhije, n'umutwaro wanjye utaremereye.”
