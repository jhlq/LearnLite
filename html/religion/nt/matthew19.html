<h1>Matthew 19:1-30</h1>

<p>Mt 19:1-30</p>

<p>[1]Jesus had now finished what he wanted to say, and he left Galilee and came into the territory of Judaea on the far side of the Jordan.</p>

<p>[1]Yesu arangije ayo magambo ava i Galilaya, ajya mu gihugu cy'i Yudaya hakurya ya Yorodani.</p>

<p>[2]Large crowds followed him and he healed them there.</p>

<p>[2]Abantu benshi baramukurikira, abakirizayo.</p>

<p>[3]Some Pharisees approached him, and to put him to the test they said, 'Is it against the Law for a man to divorce his wife on any pretext whatever?'</p>

<p>[3]Abafarisayo baza aho ari baramugerageza, baramubaza bati “Mbese amategeko yemera ko umuntu asenda umugore we amuhora ikintu cyose?”</p>

<p>[4]He answered, 'Have you not read that the Creator from the beginning made them male and female</p>

<p>[4]Na we arabasubiza ati “Ntimwari mwasoma yuko Iyabaremye mbere yaremye umugabo n'umugore,</p>

<p>[5]and that he said: This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes attached to his wife, and the two become one flesh?</p>

<p>[5]ikababwira iti ‘Ni cyo gituma umuntu azasiga se na nyina akabana n'umugore we akaramata, bombi bakaba umubiri umwe'?</p>

<p>[6]They are no longer two, therefore, but one flesh. So then, what God has united, human beings must not divide.'</p>

<p>[6]Bituma batakiri babiri, ahubwo babaye umubiri umwe. Nuko icyo Imana yateranyije hamwe, umuntu ntakagitandukanye.”</p>

<p>[7]They said to him, 'Then why did Moses command that a writ of dismissal should be given in cases of divorce?'</p>

<p>[7]Baramubaza bati “Niba ari uko, ni iki cyatumye Mose ategeka ko umugabo aha umugore urwandiko rwo kumusenda, abone uko yamwirukana?”</p>

<p>[8]He said to them, 'It was because you were so hard-hearted, that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but it was not like this from the beginning.</p>

<p>[8]Arabasubiza ati “Mose yabemereye gusenda abagore banyu kuko imitima yanyu inangiye, ariko uhereye mbere hose ntibyari bimeze bityo.</p>

<p>[9]Now I say this to you: anyone who divorces his wife -- I am not speaking of an illicit marriage -- and marries another, is guilty of adultery.'</p>

<p>[9]Ariko ndababwira yuko umuntu wese uzasenda umugore we atamuhora gusambana, akarongora undi azaba asambanye. Kandi ucyura uwasenzwe na we aba asambanye.”</p>

<p>[10]The disciples said to him, 'If that is how things are between husband and wife, it is advisable not to marry.'</p>

<p>[10]Abigishwa be baramubwira bati “Iby'umugabo n'umugore we niba bigenda bityo, noneho kurongora si byiza.”</p>

<p>[11]But he replied, 'It is not everyone who can accept what I have said, but only those to whom it is granted.</p>

<p>[11]Na we arababwira ati “Abantu bose ntibabasha kwemera iryo jambo, keretse ababihawe.</p>

<p>[12]There are eunuchs born so from their mother's womb, there are eunuchs made so by human agency and there are eunuchs who have made themselves so for the sake of the kingdom of Heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.'</p>

<p>[12]Kuko hariho ibiremba byavutse bityo mu nda za ba nyina, hariho n'inkone zakonwe n'abantu, hariho n'inkone zīkona ubwazo ku bw'ubwami bwo mu ijuru. Ubasha kubyemera abyemere.”</p>

<p>[13]Then people brought little children to him, for him to lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples scolded them,</p>

<p>[13]Maze bamuzanira abana bato ngo abarambikeho ibiganza abasabire, abigishwa barabacyaha.</p>

<p>[14]but Jesus said, 'Let the little children alone, and do not stop them from coming to me; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of Heaven belongs.'</p>

<p>[14]Ariko Yesu arababwira ati “Mureke abana bato ntimubabuze kunsanga, kuko abameze batyo ubwami bwo mu ijuru ari ubwabo.”</p>

<p>[15]Then he laid his hands on them and went on his way.</p>

<p>[15]Amaze kubarambikaho ibiganza, avayo.</p>

<p>[16]And now a man came to him and asked, 'Master, what good deed must I do to possess eternal life?'</p>

<p>[16]Nuko umuntu aza aho ari aramubaza ati “Mwigisha mwiza, nkore cyiza ki ngo mpabwe ubugingo buhoraho?”</p>

<p>[17]Jesus said to him, 'Why do you ask me about what is good? There is one alone who is good. But if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.'</p>

<p>[17]Na we aramusubiza ati“Unyitira iki mwiza? Umwiza ni umwe gusa, ni Imana. Ariko nushaka kugera ku bugingo, witondere amategeko.”</p>

<p>[18]He said, 'Which ones?' Jesus replied, 'These: You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false witness.</p>

<p>[18]Aramubaza ati “Ni ayahe?”Yesu aramusubiza ati “Ntukice, ntugasambane, ntukibe, ntukabeshyere abandi,</p>

<p>[19]Honour your father and your mother. You shall love your neighbour as yourself.'</p>

<p>[19]wubahe so na nyoko, ukunde mugenzi wawe nk'uko wikunda.”</p>

<p>[20]The young man said to him, 'I have kept all these. What more do I need to do?'</p>

<p>[20]Uwo muhungu aramubwira ati “Ayo yose narayitondeye. None icyo nshigaje ni iki?”</p>

<p>[21]Jesus said, 'If you wish to be perfect, go and sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.'</p>

<p>[21]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Nushaka kuba utunganye rwose, genda ugurishe ibyo utunze maze uhe abakene, ni bwo uzagira ubutunzi mu ijuru, uhereko uze unkurikire.”</p>

<p>[22]But when the young man heard these words he went away sad, for he was a man of great wealth.</p>

<p>[22]Uwo musore yumvise iryo jambo agenda afite agahinda, kuko yari afite ubutunzi bwinshi.</p>

<p>[23]Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'In truth I tell you, it is hard for someone rich to enter the kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>[23]Yesu abwira abigishwa be ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko biruhije ko umutunzi yinjira mu bwami bwo mu ijuru.</p>

<p>[24]Yes, I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone rich to enter the kingdom of Heaven.'</p>

<p>[24]Ndetse ndababwira yuko icyoroshye ari uko ingamiya yanyura mu zuru ry'urushinge, kuruta ko umutunzi yakwinjira mu bwami bwo mu ijuru.”</p>

<p>[25]When the disciples heard this they were astonished. 'Who can be saved, then?' they said.</p>

<p>[25]Abigishwa babyumvise barumirwa cyane bati “Ubwo bimeze bityo, ni nde ushobora gukizwa?”</p>

<p>[26]Jesus gazed at them. 'By human resources', he told them, 'this is impossible; for God everything is possible.'</p>

<p>[26]Yesu arabitegereza arababwira ati “Ibyo ntibishobokera abantu, ariko ku Mana byose birashoboka.”</p>

<p>[27]Then Peter answered and said, 'Look, we have left everything and followed you. What are we to have, then?'</p>

<p>[27]Maze Petero aramubaza ati “Dore twebwe ko twasize byose tukagukurikira, none se tuzamera dute?”</p>

<p>[28]Jesus said to them, 'In truth I tell you, when everything is made new again and the Son of man is seated on his throne of glory, you yourselves will sit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>[28]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko mwebwe abankurikiye, mu gihe cyo guhindura byose ngo bibe bishya, ubwo Umwana w'umuntu azicara ku ntebe y'icyubahiro cye, namwe muzicara ku ntebe cumi n'ebyiri, mucire imiryango cumi n'ibiri y'Abisirayeli imanza.</p>

<p>[29]And everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children or land for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much, and also inherit eternal life.</p>

<p>[29]Umuntu wese wasize urugo cyangwa bene se cyangwa bashiki be, cyangwa se cyangwa nyina cyangwa abana, cyangwa amasambu ku bw'izina ryanjye, azahabwa ibibiruta incuro ijana, kandi azaragwa n'ubugingo buhoraho.</p>

<p>[30]'Many who are first will be last, and the last, first.'</p>

<p>[30]Ariko benshi b'imbere bazaba ab'inyuma, kandi ab'inyuma bazaba ab'imbere.
