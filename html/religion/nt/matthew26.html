<h1>Matthew 26:1-75</h1>

<p>Mt 26:1-30,0,31-75</p>

<p>[1]Jesus had now finished all he wanted to say, and he told his disciples,</p>

<p>[1]Nuko Yesu arangije ayo magambo yose abwira abigishwa be ati</p>

<p>[2]'It will be Passover, as you know, in two days' time, and the Son of man will be handed over to be crucified.'</p>

<p>[2]“Muzi yuko iminsi ibiri nishira hazabaho Pasika, Umwana w'umuntu azagambanirwa abambwe.”</p>

<p>[3]Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,</p>

<p>[3]Maze abatambyi bakuru n'abakuru b'ubwo bwoko, bateranira mu rugo rw'Umutambyi mukuru witwaga Kayafa,</p>

<p>[4]and made plans to arrest Jesus by some trick and have him put to death.</p>

<p>[4]bagira inama hamwe yo koshyoshya Yesu ngo babone uko bamufata, bamwice.</p>

<p>[5]They said, however, 'It must not be during the festivities; there must be no disturbance among the people.'</p>

<p>[5]Ariko baravuga bati “Twe kumufata mu minsi mikuru, kugira ngo bidatera abantu imidugararo.”</p>

<p>[6]Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon, a man who had suffered from a virulent skin-disease, when</p>

<p>[6]Yesu ari i Betaniya mu nzu ya Simoni umubembe,</p>

<p>[7]a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and poured it on his head as he was at table.</p>

<p>[7]umugore aza aho ari afite umukondo w'amavuta meza, ameze nk'amadahano y'igiciro cyinshi cyane, ayamusuka ku mutwe yicaye arya.</p>

<p>[8]When they saw this, the disciples said indignantly, 'Why this waste?</p>

<p>[8]Abigishwa babibonye bararakara bati “Aya mavuta apfiriye iki ubusa,</p>

<p>[9]This could have been sold for a high price and the money given the poor.'</p>

<p>[9]ko yajyaga kugurwa impiya nyinshi zigafasha abakene?”</p>

<p>[10]But Jesus noticed this and said, 'Why are you upsetting the woman? What she has done for me is indeed a good work!</p>

<p>[10]Ariko Yesu abimenye arababaza ati “Uyu mugore muramuterera iki agahinda, ko ankoreye umurimo mwiza?</p>

<p>[11]You have the poor with you always, but you will not always have me.</p>

<p>[11]Abakene muri kumwe na bo iteka, ariko jyeweho ntituri kumwe iteka.</p>

<p>[12]When she poured this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</p>

<p>[12]Igitumye uyu mugore ansukaho ayo mavuta ku mubiri, ni ukuwutunganiriza guhambwa.</p>

<p>[13]In truth I tell you, wherever in all the world this gospel is proclaimed, what she has done will be told as well, in remembrance of her.'</p>

<p>[13]Ndababwira ukuri yuko aho ubutumwa bwiza buzigishirizwa hose mu isi yose, icyo uyu mugore ankoreye kizavugirwa kugira ngo bamwibuke.”</p>

<p>[14]Then one of the Twelve, the man called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</p>

<p>[14]Hanyuma umwe muri abo cumi na babiri witwaga Yuda Isikariyota, asanga abatambyi bakuru</p>

<p>[15]and said, 'What are you prepared to give me if I hand him over to you?' They paid him thirty silver pieces,</p>

<p>[15]arababaza ati “Mwampa iki nkamubagenzereza?” Bamugerera ibice by'ifeza mirongo itatu,</p>

<p>[16]and from then onwards he began to look for an opportunity to betray him.</p>

<p>[16]aherako ashaka uburyo yamubagenzereza.</p>

<p>[17]Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus to say, 'Where do you want us to make the preparations for you to eat the Passover?'</p>

<p>[17]Ku munsi wa mbere wo kurya imitsima idasembuwe, abigishwa begera Yesu baramubaza bati “Urashaka ko dutunganiriza he aho uri burīre ibya Pasika?”</p>

<p>[18]He said, 'Go to a certain man in the city and say to him, "The Master says: My time is near. It is at your house that I am keeping Passover with my disciples." '</p>

<p>[18]Arabasubiza ati “Mujye mu murwa kwa ntuza, mumubwire muti ‘Umwigisha aravuze ngo igihe cye kirenda kugera, ngo iwawe ni ho ari busangirire ibya Pasika n'abigishwa be.' ”</p>

<p>[19]The disciples did what Jesus told them and prepared the Passover.</p>

<p>[19]Abigishwa bagenza uko Yesu yababwiye, baringaniza ibya Pasika.</p>

<p>[20]When evening came he was at table with the Twelve.</p>

<p>[20]Bugorobye yicarana n'abigishwa cumi na babiri ngo basangire.</p>

<p>[21]And while they were eating he said, 'In truth I tell you, one of you is about to betray me.'</p>

<p>[21]Bakirya arababwira ati “Ndababwira ukuri, yuko umwe muri mwe ari bungambanire.”</p>

<p>[22]They were greatly distressed and started asking him in turn, 'Not me, Lord, surely?'</p>

<p>[22]Barababara cyane, baherako bamubaza umwe umwe bati “Mwami, ni jye?”</p>

<p>[23]He answered, 'Someone who has dipped his hand into the dish with me will betray me.</p>

<p>[23]Na we arabasubiza ati “Uwo duhuriza amaboko ku mbehe, ni we uri bungambanire.</p>

<p>[24]The Son of man is going to his fate, as the scriptures say he will, but alas for that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Better for that man if he had never been born!'</p>

<p>[24]Umwana w'umuntu aragenda nk'uko byanditswe kuri we, ariko uwo muntu ugambanira Umwana w'umuntu azabona ishyano, ibyajyaga kumubera byiza ni uko aba ataravutse.”</p>

<p>[25]Judas, who was to betray him, asked in his turn, 'Not me, Rabbi, surely?' Jesus answered, 'It is you who say it.'</p>

<p>[25]Yuda uwo wari ugiye kumugambanira aramubaza ati “Mwigisha, ni jye?”Aramusubiza ati “Wakabimenye.”</p>

<p>[26]Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had said the blessing he broke it and gave it to the disciples. 'Take it and eat,' he said, 'this is my body.'</p>

<p>[26]Bakirya Yesu yenda umutsima arawushimira, arawumanyagura, awuha abigishwa be arababwira ati “Nimwende murye, uyu ni umubiri wanjye.”</p>

<p>[27]Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he handed it to them saying, 'Drink from this, all of you,</p>

<p>[27]Yenda igikombe aragishimira, arakibaha, arababwira ati “Munywere kuri iki mwese,</p>

<p>[28]for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</p>

<p>[28]kuko aya ari amaraso yanjye y'isezerano rishya, ava ku bwa benshi ngo bababarirwe ibyaha.</p>

<p>[29]From now on, I tell you, I shall never again drink wine until the day I drink the new wine with you in the kingdom of my Father.'</p>

<p>[29]Ariko ndababwira rwose yuko ntazanywa ku mbuto z'imizabibu, mpereye none nkageza umunsi nzasangirira namwe vino nshya mu bwami bwa Data.”</p>

<p>[30]After the psalms had been sung they left for the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>[30]Bamaze kuririmba barasohoka, bajya ku musozi wa Elayono. [0](Mar 14.27-31; Luka 22.31-34; Yoh 13.36-38)</p>

<p>[31]Then Jesus said to them, 'You will all fall away from me tonight, for the scripture says: I shall strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered,</p>

<p>[31]Maze Yesu arababwira ati “Mwebwe mwese iri joro ibyanjye birabahemuza, kuko byanditswe ngo ‘Nzakubita umwungeri, umukumbi w'intama usandare.'</p>

<p>[32]but after my resurrection I shall go ahead of you to Galilee.'</p>

<p>[32]Ariko nimara kuzūrwa, nzababanziriza kujya i Galilaya.”</p>

<p>[33]At this, Peter said to him, 'Even if all fall away from you, I will never fall away.'</p>

<p>[33]Maze Petero aramusubiza ati “Nubwo bose ibyawe biri bubagushe, jyeweho ntabwo bizangusha.”</p>

<p>[34]Jesus answered him, 'In truth I tell you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will have disowned me three times.'</p>

<p>[34]Yesu aramubwira ati “Ndakubwira ukuri yuko muri iri joro, inkoko itarabika uri bunyihakane gatatu.”</p>

<p>[35]Peter said to him, 'Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.' And all the disciples said the same.</p>

<p>[35]Petero aramubwira ati “Naho byatuma mpfana nawe, na bwo sindi bukwihakane na hato.” N'abandi bigishwa bose bavuga batyo.</p>

<p>[36]Then Jesus came with them to a plot of land called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, 'Stay here while I go over there to pray.'</p>

<p>[36]Maze Yesu agerana na bo ahitwa i Getsemani, abwira abigishwa be ati “Nimube mwicaye aha nigire hariya nsenge.”</p>

<p>[37]He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. And he began to feel sadness and anguish.</p>

<p>[37]Ajyana Petero na bene Zebedayo bombi, atangira kubabara no guhagarika umutima cyane.</p>

<p>[38]Then he said to them, 'My soul is sorrowful to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake with me.'</p>

<p>[38]Maze arababwira ati “Umutima wanjye ufite agahinda kenshi kenda kunyica. Mugume hano, mubane maso nanjye.”</p>

<p>[39]And going on a little further he fell on his face and prayed. 'My Father,' he said, 'if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would have it.'</p>

<p>[39]Yigira imbere ho hato arunama, arasenga ati “Data, niba bishoboka iki gikombe kindenge, ariko bye kuba uko jyewe nshaka, ahubwo bibe uko wowe ushaka.”</p>

<p>[40]He came back to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, 'So you had not the strength to stay awake with me for one hour?</p>

<p>[40]Agaruka aho abigishwa bari asanga basinziriye, abaza Petero ati “Harya ntimubashije kubana maso nanjye isaha imwe?</p>

<p>[41]Stay awake, and pray not to be put to the test. The spirit is willing enough, but human nature is weak.'</p>

<p>[41]Mube maso, musenge mutajya mu moshya. Umutima ni wo ukunze, ariko umubiri ufite intege nke.”</p>

<p>[42]Again, a second time, he went away and prayed: 'My Father,' he said, 'if this cup cannot pass by, but I must drink it, your will be done!'</p>

<p>[42]Yongera kugenda ubwa kabiri arasenga ati “Data, niba bidashoboka ko iki kindenga, ngo kereka nkinywereyeho, ibyo ushaka abe ari byo biba.”</p>

<p>[43]And he came back again and found them sleeping, their eyes were so heavy.</p>

<p>[43]Yongeye kugaruka asanga basinziriye, kuko amaso yabo aremereye.</p>

<p>[44]Leaving them there, he went away again and prayed for the third time, repeating the same words.</p>

<p>[44]Arongera abasiga aho aragenda, asenga ubwa gatatu avuga amagambo amwe n'aya mbere.</p>

<p>[45]Then he came back to the disciples and said to them, 'You can sleep on now and have your rest. Look, the hour has come when the Son of man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>

<p>[45]Maze agaruka aho abigishwa bari arababwira ati “Musinzire noneho, muruhuke. Dore igihe kirenda gusohora, Umwana w'umuntu agambaniwe mu maboko y'abanyabyaha.</p>

<p>[46]Get up! Let us go! Look, my betrayer is not far away.'</p>

<p>[46]Nimubyuke tugende, dore ungenza ari hafi.”</p>

<p>[47]And suddenly while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared, and with him a large number of men armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.</p>

<p>[47]Akibivuga, Yuda umwe muri abo cumi na babiri azana n'igitero kinini gifite inkota n'inshyimbo, giturutse ku batambyi bakuru n'abakuru b'ubwo bwoko.</p>

<p>[48]Now the traitor had arranged a sign with them saying, 'The one I kiss, he is the man. Arrest him.'</p>

<p>[48]Ariko umugambanira yari yabahaye ikimenyetso ati “Uwo ndi busome, ni we uwo mumufate.”</p>

<p>[49]So he went up to Jesus at once and said, 'Greetings, Rabbi,' and kissed him.</p>

<p>[49]Uwo mwanya yegera Yesu aramubwira ati “Ni amahoro Mwigisha”, aramusomagura.</p>

<p>[50]Jesus said to him, 'My friend, do what you are here for.' Then they came forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.</p>

<p>[50]Yesu aramubwira ati “Mugenzi wanjye, kora ikikuzanye.”Maze baraza basumira Yesu, baramufata.</p>

<p>[51]And suddenly, one of the followers of Jesus grasped his sword and drew it; he struck the high priest's servant and cut off his ear.</p>

<p>[51]Umwe muri abo bari kumwe na Yesu arambura ukuboko, akura inkota ye, ayikubita umugaragu w'Umutambyi mukuru, amuca ugutwi.</p>

<p>[52]Jesus then said, 'Put your sword back, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.</p>

<p>[52]Maze Yesu aramubwira ati “Subiza inkota yawe mu rwubati rwayo, kuko abatwara inkota bose bazicwa n'inkota.</p>

<p>[53]Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, who would promptly send more than twelve legions of angels to my defence?</p>

<p>[53]Mbese wibwira yuko ntabasha gusaba Data, akanyoherereza abamarayika nonaha basāga legiyoni cumi n'ebyiri?</p>

<p>[54]But then, how would the scriptures be fulfilled that say this is the way it must be?'</p>

<p>[54]Ariko rero bibaye bityo, ibyanditswe byasohora bite kandi ari ko bikwiriye kuba?”</p>

<p>[55]It was at this time that Jesus said to the crowds, 'Am I a bandit, that you had to set out to capture me with swords and clubs? I sat teaching in the Temple day after day and you never laid a hand on me.'</p>

<p>[55]Uwo mwanya Yesu abaza igitero ati “Harya muhurujwe no kumfata nk'uko muzira umwambuzi, mufite inkota n'inshyimbo? Nicaraga mu rusengero iminsi yose nigisha, kuki mutamfashe?</p>

<p>[56]Now all this happened to fulfil the prophecies in scripture. Then all the disciples deserted him and ran away.</p>

<p>[56]Ariko ibi byose bibereyeho kugira ngo ibyanditswe n'abahanuzi bisohore.”Nuko abigishwa bose baramuhāna, barahunga.</p>

<p>[57]The men who had arrested Jesus led him off to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>

<p>[57]Abafashe Yesu bamujyana kwa Kayafa Umutambyi mukuru, ari ho abanditsi n'abakuru bari bateraniye.</p>

<p>[58]Peter followed him at a distance right to the high priest's palace, and he went in and sat down with the attendants to see what the end would be.</p>

<p>[58]Petero amukurikira arenga ahinguka agera ku rugo rw'Umutambyi mukuru, arujyamo yicarana n'abagaragu ngo arebe amaherezo.</p>

<p>[59]The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus, however false, on which they might have him executed.</p>

<p>[59]Maze abatambyi bakuru n'abanyarukiko bose bashaka Yesu ho ibirego by'ibinyoma ngo babone uko bamwica,</p>

<p>[60]But they could not find any, though several lying witnesses came forward. Eventually two came forward</p>

<p>[60]barabibura nubwo haje abagabo b'ibinyoma benshi. Hanyuma haza babiri</p>

<p>[61]and made a statement, 'This man said, "I have power to destroy the Temple of God and in three days build it up." '</p>

<p>[61]baravuga bati “Uyu yagize ngo yabasha gusenya urusengero rw'Imana, akarwubaka mu minsi itatu.”</p>

<p>[62]The high priest then rose and said to him, 'Have you no answer to that? What is this evidence these men are bringing against you?'</p>

<p>[62]Umutambyi mukuru arahaguruka aramubaza ati “Ntiwiregura na hato? Ntiwumvise ibyo aba bakureze?”</p>

<p>[63]But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, 'I put you on oath by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.'</p>

<p>[63]Yesu aricecekera. Umutambyi mukuru aramubwira ati “Nkurahirije Imana ihoraho, tubwire niba ari wowe Kristo, Umwana w'Imana.”</p>

<p>[64]Jesus answered him, 'It is you who say it. But, I tell you that from this time onward you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.'</p>

<p>[64]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Wakabimenye, kandi ndababwira yuko hanyuma muzabona Umwana w'umuntu yicaye iburyo bw'ubushobozi bw'Imana, aje ku bicu byo mu ijuru.”</p>

<p>[65]Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, 'He has blasphemed. What need of witnesses have we now? There! You have just heard the blasphemy.</p>

<p>[65]Umutambyi mukuru abyumvise atyo ashishimura imyenda ye ati “Arigereranije. Turacyashakira iki abagabo? Dore noneho mwiyumviye kwigereranya kwe.</p>

<p>[66]What is your opinion?' They answered, 'He deserves to die.'</p>

<p>[66]Muratekereza iki?”Baramusubiza bati “Akwiriye kwicwa.”</p>

<p>[67]Then they spat in his face and hit him with their fists; others said as they struck him,</p>

<p>[67]Nuko bamucira amacandwe mu maso, bamukubita ibipfunsi, abandi bamukubita inshyi bati</p>

<p>[68]'Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you then?'</p>

<p>[68]“Duhanure Kristo, ni nde ugukubise?”</p>

<p>[69]Meanwhile Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came up to him saying, 'You, too, were with Jesus the Galilean.'</p>

<p>[69]Ubwo Petero yari yicaye hanze mu rugo, umuja aramwegera aramubwira ati “Nawe wari kumwe na Yesu w'Umunyagalilaya.”</p>

<p>[70]But he denied it in front of them all. 'I do not know what you are talking about,' he said.</p>

<p>[70]Maze abihakanira imbere ya bose ati “Ibyo uvuze sinzi ibyo ari byo.”</p>

<p>[71]When he went out to the gateway another servant-girl saw him and said to the people there, 'This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.'</p>

<p>[71]Arasohoka ageze mu bikingi by'amarembo undi muja aramubona, abwira abahari ati “N'uyu yari kumwe na Yesu w'i Nazareti.”</p>

<p>[72]And again, with an oath, he denied it, 'I do not know the man.'</p>

<p>[72]Yongera kubihakana arahira ati “Uwo muntu simuzi.”</p>

<p>[73]A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, 'You are certainly one of them too! Why, your accent gives you away.'</p>

<p>[73]Hashize umwanya muto, abari bahagaze aho baraza babwira Petero bati “Ni ukuri nawe uri umwe muri bo, ndetse ni imvugo yawe irakumenyekanishije.”</p>

<p>[74]Then he started cursing and swearing, 'I do not know the man.' And at once the cock crowed,</p>

<p>[74]Maze atangira kwivuma no kurahira ati “Uwo muntu simuzi.”Muri ako kanya inkoko irabika.</p>

<p>[75]and Peter remembered what Jesus had said, 'Before the cock crows you will have disowned me three times.' And he went outside and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>[75]Petero yibuka ijambo Yesu yari yavuze ati “Inkoko itarabika uri bunyihakane gatatu.” Arasohoka ararira cyane.
