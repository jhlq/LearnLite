<h1>Gravity</h1></p>

<p>Anyone who has ever ran a simulation of the common spacetime diagram of gravity where planets appear on a elastic sheet knows that it is not an optimal representation of what is actually going on: the spheres on the sheet do not neatly revolve around eachother but rather quickly crash together.</p>

<p>What does the diagram really represent? In places of greater mass the sheet is lower, since mass warps spacetime the depth indicates how much spacetime has been pulled together: Volume around a heavy object is contracted, for a box to contain the same amount of volume while moving down the sheet it has to become relatively smaller.</p>

<img src="straightCircles.png" alt="straightCircles.png">

<p>Each box contains an equal area, in other words each circle is a straight line. This effect also explains why no object traveling at finite speed can return from the horizon of a black hole: it would have to travel an infinite distance.</p>
