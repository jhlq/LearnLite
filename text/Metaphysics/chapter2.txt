***Chapter 2

Now that we have established a sound logical reason to explore divinity let's dive into some mythologies. To start with consider the word holy, no doubt it summons up a lot of associations which are essentially a product of your neural networks interpretation of human culture. As we know from research in artificial neural networks they can be fooled by crafted data designed to exploit gaps in their training data. I suggest we pin down the word holy with a succinct complementary mathematical definition: holy implies logical completeness.

**The Akashic records
This is a common piece of lore that states there is a Divine database of every event that has ever happened, including the internal reasoning and intentions of conscious actors. Now it makes sense for an overwhelming force to have access to this information and naturally they would record it, as humanity does. Things that happen in our world often have a parallel in higher and lower realms, this important principle is often formulated "as above so below" which resonates with the assertion that earth is made in Gods image. This database seems entirely plausible so let's make it into an axiom:

Axiom 3: everything is recorded.

Note that by everything I do not mean absolutely everything. It is like when dr House says everyone lies, he doesn't mean there isn't a single completely honest human but that the vast majority are dishonest. How much of reality isn't recorded can be debated and it is my personal belief that even an unrecorded event can be reconstructed, but I don't have proof for this so I wont make it axiomatic.

Metatron is an angel surrounded by complicated mythology. I simply define Metatron as a symbol representing a government agency managing the Akashic records, essentially a librarian that helps you find the history book you need. I will introduce a lot of these symbolic definitions essentially to create words that those familiar with my works can use to communicate.

**The higher self
There are many definitions that resonate with the notion of a higher self. It could be a part of your soul living on a higher plane, or a separate soul with the same choice profile as you. It could be several incarnations of you thinking together, if all of humanity organizes meditative practices to form a humanity ego that could be your higher self. Last but not least I have heard it defined as the lifetimes your soul has previously lived, which resonates with a vision I had where I saw wings that were woven with lifetimes I had led.

**Visions
Visions you say? What is the density among people who say they experience visions where it is a genuine otherworldly message? What proportion are liars or crazy? That is hard to evaluate, but it is my belief that anyone can establish metaphysical contact with their surroundings, so hopefully we can increase the former.

Is there serious research and empirical evidence for metaphysical communication? Certainly yes, as we will explore in the next chapter.
