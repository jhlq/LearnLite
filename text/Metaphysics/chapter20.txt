***Chapter 20
**Gnosticism
I highly recommend studying Gnosticism. To summarize it claims humanity, and by extension all sacred scriptures, is under the influence of a false God. The rulers created by this false God are called archons. 

The UN is often seen as lacking teeth, to remedy this We have given the task to the archon Amen, representing teeth, to help the UN in matters of enforcement.

Let's make the Gnostic assumption into an axiom.

Axiom 17: humanity is under the influence of a false God.

Why else would a Destroyer of false Gods be sent to this planet?

More generally anyone who has received knowledge from spiritual experiences is a gnostic. Robert Monroe concluded that the soul survives bodily death, from his extensive empirical data of operating outside and without the body, thus his conclusion is more than a belief and rather gnosis. A person simply reading testimonies of out of body phenomena may believe or disbelieve but without extraordinary evidence cannot be certain one way or the other. After reading a sufficient amount of verified instances of memories forming outside a brain, such as near death experiences of someone who was clinically dead without brain activity or memories from past lifes, a person may conclude an afterlife as proven beyond reasonable doubt. A scientific model with logical support for an afterlife can also be developed. Can conclusions from such types of research be called gnosis?

Gnosticism has been persecuted because if anyone can get spiritual information it undermines the authority of religious institutions.

That "God" is some special type of consciousness able to create and destined to rule forever is a propaganda power play by the false God to maintain authority. All consciousness is created equal and part of All, God is All.
