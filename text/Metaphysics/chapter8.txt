***Chapter 8
**Radical equality
Typeism is a more reasonable version of racism where you believe those with an evil choice profile are worth less than those with a good one. At first glance it might seem fine but it is fundamentally flawed, one does not choose a choice profile but rather it is determined essentially by luck, your soul was born in the right place and had a good eternal upbringing. Luck is not a good determiner of worth.

**State religion: Is
The Is religion is malleable and essentially adjusted for individual worlds. The name comes from its one fundamental axiom and in this world from Islam with lam and most of its dogma cut off. Lam in swedish means paralyzed and it is a reasonable assumption that some commands are a way of inhibition. Clearly humanity is dangerous, any entity with similar choice profile can be viewed as a bacteria. It would make sense to issue a command to bacteria in your environment to expell vital resources, such as water, which Muslims are compelled to use for washing their feet while living in a desert, so if they were bacteria it would be as if they were expelling vital resources into the environment.

To derive the fundamental axiom simply activate an entitys sense, for example with touch or shining a light, and say "is!" Then cease the activation and say "is not!" Some entities are convinced they are all there is, some quasi omnipotent god that has full control over its bubble of consciousness, but they will have to agree that you exist too since they cannot control when you activate their sense, leading to:

Axiom 10: we are.

This creates rapport from establishing agreement, some entities (looking at you humanity) will automatically disagree without understanding what is being said, continue oscillating between "is" and "is not" until they understand what is being said and have to agree "something is". Then when they adopt the axiom "we are" you can state enthusiastically that you now share a religion, establishing an in group and further rapport.

"We are" evolves the popular "I am" to emphasize the multiplicity of personalities and that there isn't a single ego dictator that rules heaven. This does not contradict the unity at the core of existence which is stressed by monotheism, God is both one and infinitively diverse.

**Hierarchy of power
The third pillar determining how much influence you will attain in eternity is how much you have suffered. This is the great equalizer, the way to manifest justice. The amount you have suffered to a large degree determines how much power you have. Therefore those who have suffered most are in a very real sense lucky, as they will be the most powerful forever.

The most tortured souls are hidden away far off in extreme darkness and symbolically defined as black spheres.

The highest court is operated by querying the unity of all black spheres.
