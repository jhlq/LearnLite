**Week 1

Web design, WWW, URI/URL, protocols, client-server.

Chapters LWD 1-3, EUE 1.

*Lecture

Introduction to web technology

Design, development, construction, technology, technique.

Theory. Planning and structuring. Information architecture, user centric design.

HTML, XML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP...

The world wide web is a subset of the internet.

<ul>
Babbage invented a programmable calculator in the 19th century.
1930: electric computers
1940: electron pipes
1947: transistor
1958: integrated circuit
1971: microprocessor
1990: World Wide Web
2000: Mobile internet
2010: Social web
</ul>

Take the user into account every step of the way. Why? Who? What? How? Where?

User friendly (simple UI) - > Usability (efficient goal achievability) - > User experience (emotions)

Data - > information - > knowledge

Information architecture: organisation, structuring, labeling and navigation systems.

Information architects develop visions, contents, structures, maintenance and extendability.

Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME):
<ul>
text/plain
text/html
text/css
image/jpeg
image/gif
video/mpeg
...
</ul>

A website directory tree is made either with folders on the server or a virtual router that registers paths to be handled by certain functions.

URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):
<ul>
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
URN (Uniform Resource Name)
</ul>

scheme://username:password@domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id

The file:/// scheme is only for local files on a personal computer.

Internal links can be specified relatively with ../file.htm or from site root (on server only) as /path/index.html

Do not use special characters in file names. Use _ or - instead of spaces. Preferably lower case only.

The inter- prefix means between.

<ul>
LAN: Local Area Network
WAN: Wide Area Network
Router: Directs traffic
Gateway: Network entrance
Firewall: Blocking gateway
</ul>

Every computer on the internet has a unique IP, either IPv4 or the more recent IPv6.

DNS servers translate domain names to IP addresses. It is possible to connect to a server by typing the IP directly.

Ports are connection locations on a computer. Numbers range from 0 to 65535 where 0-1023 are reserved, 25 is for email and 80 http. A temporary webserver is usually assigned 8080. Traffic to 80 can be directed to 8080 with iptables or a proxy server. Connect to a custom port like so: http://server.xyz:8080

Protocols define data transfers, TCP/IP is fundamental for the web.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) divides messages into numbered packages.

HTTP (80), FTP (20/21), Telnet (23) and SMTP (25) all use TCP/IP.

*Lesson

Responsive design adapts to screen size.

<ul>
Analyse: purpose, target groups, technology.
Requirements specification: content, functionality.
Plan: organization (categories, labels), structure (pages), navigation, metadata.
Create: prototypes, layout.
Test: user testing, requirements evaluation, validation, technology testing.
Publish: marketing.
Maintenance and development: update content, analyse usage, plan new functions.
</ul>

Garretts model:
<ul>
Strategy: user needs, product objectives
Scope: functional specifications, content requirements
Structure: interaction design, information architecture
Skeleton: interface design, navigation design, information design
Surface: sensory design
</ul>

Accessible for blind, deaf, armless, dyslectic, limited internet, mobile.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ Web accessibility initiative.

*Laboration

Introduction to FirstClass.

Create web page folders and edit existing code.

Publish web pages so they can be viewed in a browser.

**Week 2

HTML, validation, languages for the web, information architecture, user centric design.

Chapters LWD 4-7, EUE 2.

*Lecture

HTML files can also end with .htm

HTML = HyperText Markup Language (Hyper is greek for above)

&lt;tag attribute="value"&gt;Content&lt;/tag&gt;

Prefix keywords with &amp; for special symbols: copy; = &copy; = ©, euro; = &euro; = €, amp; = &amp;, lt; = &lt;, gt; = &gt;

Tags: !doctype html, html, head, meta charset="UTF-8", title, body.

The World Wide Web started at CERN in 1989, available on the internet 1991.

XHTML is more strict.

By validating code we ensure it follows the W3C standard.

<ul>
https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss
https://webplatform.github.io/docs/
https://www.w3schools.com/
</ul>

https://validator.nu/

Conceptual plan:
<ul>
Purpose, content, target group.
Structure and navigation system.
Presentation and UI.
Metadata.
Administration and development.
</ul>

What technology and other resources are needed? How will testing be performed?

Field analysis - > planning - > design - > production - > final product.

Development is iterative, user centric and revolving around evaluation.

<ul>
How should it look?
Where will buttons go?
What shall the user do?
Who are the users?
</ul>

Garretts model has two sides: functionality and information.

Try prototypes to develop a common vision.

User testing should be carried out with developers directly involved to determine problem with task completions.

<ul>
Test purpose: what do you want to know and why?
Test what? Feature by feature or wholistically? Prototypes?
Designated test tasks or free roaming?
Who represents the target group? Ask for background info?
Where to find testers?
</ul>

The tester should think aloud.

Five iterations of testing followed by improvements is usually enough.

*Lesson

Specify HTML5 with < !doctype html >

Broken nesting is <b>not</b> allowed: 
!red: < x > ... < y > ... < /x > ... < /y >

< html > tags wrap < head > and < body > tags.

MB is MegaByte and Mbps is Megabits per second.

Escape special characters like so: & amp;, & lt;, & gt;, & #65; 
https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref and more...

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp < html lang="en" >

https://www.lipsum.com/ Lorem ipsum generator.

Inline elements: b, i, em, strong, sub, sup.

Relative links navigate from the path of the file on the server.

Link to an element with id="somewhere" with < a href="#somewhere" >There< /a >

Add target="_blank" to open link in new tab.

Adhere to accessibility guidelines.

Write < !-- this is not displayed -- > to add comments.

**Week 3

Target group, field analysis, strategy, accessibility, element, tag, attribute, tables.

Chapters LWD 4-8, EUE 3.

Start task 3: analysis.

Deadline task 1.

*Lecture

Block elements have their own line(s), inline elements don't. Block elements are not allowed inside inline elements.

Block: div, h1-h6, p, ol, ul, header, nav, main, footer, article, section, aside

Inline: span, a, img, b, i, strong

Use id="name" to name tags.

Global, local and contextual navigation.

Imagine a user is dropped in the middle of your site, how easy is it to navigate around?

Support: sticky navigation buttons, back-tracking bread crumbs, site map, search system, guide.

Contextual links text should be descriptive.

Labels: title, headers, link names, noun = content, verb = function.

Icons look good but can be hard to interpret.

 <b>Strategy plane</b>

What do we want? What do our users want?

Analyse purpose, goals and needs. Prepare for requirements specification.

Who are the users? What goals do they have? What do we need to know about them?

Analyse similar websites. Interview customer and users

*Lesson

Tables and structure elements.

Garretts model - Strategy plane. Start analysing purpose, goals, target users and requirements for a website.

<ul>
table, tr, th, td
caption, for accessibility
colspan, rowspan
Do not use tables for layout
</ul>

<ol>
Background analysis
Requirements specification
Structure
Layout
Style
</ol>

<ol>
Prestudie
Prototyping
Production
</ol>

<ul>
What are the goals of the website?
Study terminology and categorizing, look at similar websites.
What is the target group? Subgroups?
What do we want to know about the users? How can we get this information? Coaxing information bit by bit with small rewards like LinkedIns profile completeness score is an enticing method.
Interviews and field studies.
Personas, example users.
</ul>

Users background:
<ul>
Age, characteristics
Computer savyness, what do they do on the web, how often and through which devices?
Do they usually shop online?
Do they visit other stores and if so what do they usually buy?
Why where and when will they visit?
What do they want to see?
What do they want to do? Give suggestions
</ul>

Interview people through a online form or "in town". Observe users interacting with the website. Talk to staff.

**Week 4

Requirements specification, CSS, cascade, id, class.

Chapters LWD 11-13, EUE 4.

Task 3: analysis, requirements specification, documentation.

*Lecture

h1 {color:red; font-­‐style:italic;}

CSS can be linked in, put in a style tag in the document head or directly in a tag as a style attribute.

For id="welcome": #welcome {background­‐color:#F60; border:4px solid #930;}

For class="floatLeft": .floatLeft {float:left; height:200px;}

nav a {border:1px solid #999;}

nav ul li {display:inline;} (Note that changing a block element to display inline does not permit it to be inside a real inline element.)

The box model margins overlap.

1 em = height of normal sized font (~16px)

<ul>
a:link
a:visited
a:hover
a:active
</ul>

http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload

 <b>Scope plane</b>

Define what you are building and what you are not building.

What should users be able to do? What content should there be?

Goals, needs and analysis lead to requirements specification. Begin abstract without implementation details.

Requirements should be concrete, "that should do this" rather than "this should be easy".

Graphical profile, style guide, accessibility

*Lesson

Requirements specification and CSS.

Scope plane.

<ul>
Selectors
Units
Layout base
Link styling
Visual effects
</ul>

The requirements specification is deduced from goals and analysis of similar websites.

Technical specification and graphical profile.

<ul>
https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp
</ul>

Selectors contain references to (pseudo-)elements, attributes, ids and (pseudo-)classes.

https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp

Units can be absolute like px or relative like em (adjusts based on font size) and %.

Marginals and padding of blocks.

Navigation links can be styled as buttons.

Rounded corners, shadows and opacity.

**Week 5

Information architecture, interaction design, information design, structure, layout.

Chapters LWD 14-16, EUE 5.

Task 3: requirements specification, structure, evaluation &  testing, documentation.

*Lecture

CSS replaces the old methods of structuring pages with tables.

http://medieteknik.lnu.se/1me321/forelasningar/f5/css-ex7.zip Examples with tabs (zip).

 <b>Structure plane</b>

Shift from abstract issues of strategy and scope to conctrete factors of experience.

What and how to be done? Organization and structure.

Interaction design and information architecture is about understanding behaviour of people.

Watch out for the curse of knowledge, when we know how it is supposed to work it can be hard to realize how someone who doesn't sees it.

<ul>
Gulf of execution: distance between user goals their achievement with the system.
Gulf of evaluation: distance between the system representation and user goals.
</ul>

Information architecture is concerned with efficient navigational schemes.

Determine groups of categories and their relations.

Navigational structure can be circular.

Information should not only be easy to find but if the desired item is not present this should be quickly evident.

How to handle information belonging to multiple categories?

*Lesson

Structure and layout with CSS.

Structure plane: information architecture and interaction design.

Layout prototype: display, float, clear and overflow. Sprites.

How should the content be organized? How shall interactions be performed?

Make a structure tree.

Interaction flow.

Make columns with float and try a sticky footer.

Sprites are pictures contained within a long image that is positioned relative to a element sized to only show one picture.

http://medieteknik.lnu.se/1me321/ht/lektioner/lektion5-exempel.zip

**Week 6

UI, responsive design.

Chapters 16-19, EUE 6.

Task 3: structure, navigation, layout, evaluation % testing, documentation.

Deadline task 2.

*Lecture

Responsive design adapts to screen size.

Different css files can be loaded depending on screen max-width or with @media queries in a single file.

Specify widths with percentages. Tag: &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-­‐width, ini.al-­‐scale=1.0"&gt;

Graceful degradation and progressive enchancement. Mobile first?

http://medieteknik.lnu.se/1me321/forelasningar/f6/css-ex10.zip Adaptive elephant website (zip).

 <b>Skeleton plane</b>

Interface design concerns how to do. Information design concerns how to understand.

Navigations: global, local, contextual, supplementary, courtesy, site map.

Metaphors can be used to communicate the design.

*Lesson

Skeleton plane, responsive design with CSS and prototypes.

Navigation and form styling. Responsive design: changing layout with media queries. Transition and transform. Analyze interaction and UI.

Do, find, understand.

Create a prototype for example by cutting up pieces of paper for: page head, search field, navigation, content and footer.

Dropdown menus can cause compatibility issues.

A little box with suggested pages is called supplementary navigation.

Responsive design:
<ul>
Flexible layout (fluid grid): max-width for #wrapper and footer, specify values for width and paddings in %.
Flexible images.
CSS media queries: change to a column, remove image float, change navigation.
< meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" >
</ul>

Error handling: prevent, correct, reset.

http://medieteknik.lnu.se/1me321/ht/lektioner/lektion6-exempel.zip

**Week 7

Pictures, colors, font, style guide.

Chapters LWD 7, 13, 23-24, EUE 7.

Task 3: structure, navigation, layout, website looks, evaluation % testing, documentation.

*Lecture

A byte is 8 bits. One byte encodes 16 numbers, 0000 (0) to 1111 (F).

ASCII tables have 128 common characters and a plethora of extensions for various situations. UTF-8 standardized this jungle.

U+00E6 can be written in html as &amp;#xE6;

https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/ What every developer must know about Unicode and character sets, by the founder of stack overflow.

Bitmaps have a fixed set of pixels whereas vector graphics scale.

1 byte encodes 256 colors, a 200x150px picture becomes 30kb. 3 bytes encodes 16 million colors, the same picture becomes 90kb.

CLUT (Color LookUp Table), RGB (Red, Green, Blue), CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black), HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness).

A dpi value encodes number of pixels per area.

Images can be enlarged by replication or interpolation.

Anti-aliasing blurs edges of, for example, text.

The alpha channel specifies transparent areas.

Pictures can be compressed by only storing changes in color.

GIF: 1 byte for colors, supports transparency. JPEG: 3 bytes for colors, no transparency. PNG: variable number of colors, yes transparency.

 <b>Surface plane</b>

Fulfill the goals in a pleasing way. How should everything look?

Align colors with identity. Matt for background and clear for accentuation.

Should work for the color blind.

*Lesson

Visual design. Surface plane.

Colors and backgroundimage. Absolute positioning. 

RGD and HSL = Hue, Saturation, Lightness. 
https://pixlr.com/editor/

Graphical profile. Color pallet, font.

Images specified through CSS can be replaced easily whereas the img tag provides the useful alt attribute.

Excessive use of shadows can slow down a page.

https://validator.nu/

http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

Absolute positioning removes a block from the normal document flow.

http://medieteknik.lnu.se/1me321/ht/lektioner/lektion7-exempel.zip

**Week 8

Tables, forms, other media (sound, video, embedded external information).

Chapters LWD 8-10, 18-19, EUE 8.

Task 3: navigation, layout, website looks, evaluation &  testing, documentation.

*Lecture

Position: static, relative, fixed, absolute, top, left, bottom, right.

Hide elements with display: none / block or visibility: hidden / visible. Set position to static to expand into other content, absolute to show in a layer above.

Elements can be shown only when a link has focus or by using target.

Drop down menus can cause compatibility problems.

In CSS3 ordering of elements can be changed.

The audio tag plays mp3, wav and ogg where only mp3 works universally. The video tag plays mp4 and ogg where both have to be used for compatibility.

Media from other sources can be added with an iframe.

*Lesson

Forms, including media, user testing.

Observe users while they think out loud.

https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/

Compare with normal google searches like site:http://example.org

Enlarge images on click with an invisible checkbox that has the image as label, when checked transform the image.

The examples contain an embedded map.

Usability - > analysis of purpose - > personas - > requirements - > testing

User testing:
<ul>
Check usability and user experience.
Find flaws.
Give the user a task that they complete while thinking out loud.
Improve and repeat.
</ul>

Using display:grid does not work in IE.

Keep in mind international copyright laws.

http://medieteknik.lnu.se/1me321/ht/lektioner/lektion8-exempel.zip

**Week 9

Task 3: website looks, evaluation &  testing, documentation.

Deadline task 3.
