**Week 1

Web design, WWW, URI/URL, protocols, client-server.

Chapters LWD 1-3, EUE 1.

*Lesson

Responsive design adapts to screen size.

<ul>
Analyse: purpose, target groups, technology.
Requirements specification: content, functionality.
Plan: organization (categories, labels), structure (pages), navigation, metadata.
Create: prototypes, layout.
Test: user testing, requirements evaluation, validation, technology testing.
Publish: marketing.
Maintenance and development: update content, analyse usage, plan new functions.
</ul>

Garretts model:
<ul>
Strategy: user needs, product objectives
Scope: functional specifications, content requirements
Structure: interaction design, information architecture
Skeleton: interface design, navigation design, information design
Surface: sensory design
</ul>

Accessible for blind, deaf, armless, dyslectic, limited internet, mobile.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ Web accessibility initiative.

*Laboration

Introduction to FirstClass.

Create web page folders and edit existing code.

Publish web pages so they can be viewed in a browser.

**Week 2

HTML, validation, languages for the web, information architecture, user centric design.

Chapters LWD 4-7, EUE 2.

*Lecture

HTML files can also end with .htm

HTML = HyperText Markup Language (Hyper is greek for above)

&lt;tag attribute="value"&gt;Content&lt;/tag&gt;

Prefix keywords with &amp; for special symbols: copy; = &copy; = ©, euro; = &euro; = €, amp; = &amp;, lt; = &lt;, gt; = &gt;

Tags: !doctype html, html, head, meta charset="UTF-8", title, body.

The World Wide Web started at CERN in 1989, available on the internet 1991.

XHTML is more strict.

By validating code we ensure it follows the W3C standard.

Conceptual plan:
<ul>
Purpose, content, target group.
Structure and navigation system.
Presentation and UI.
Metadata.
Administration and development.
</ul>

What technology and other resources are needed? How will testing be performed?

Field analysis - > planning - > design - > production - > final product.

Development is iterative, user centric and revolving around evaluation.

<ul>
How should it look?
Where will buttons go?
What shall the user do?
Who are the users?
</ul>

Garretts model has two sides: functionality and information.

Try prototypes to develop a common vision.

User testing should be carried out with developers directly involved to determine problem with task completions.

<ul>
Test purpose: what do you want to know and why?
Test what? Feature by feature or wholistically? Prototypes?
Designated test tasks or free roaming?
Who represents the target group? Ask for background info?
Where to find testers?
</ul>

The tester should think aloud.

Five iterations of testing followed by improvements is usually enough.

**Week 3

Target group, field analysis, strategy, accessibility, element, tag, attribute, tables.

Chapters LWD 4-8, EUE 3.

Start task 3: analysis.

Deadline task 1.

*Lecture

Block elements have their own line(s), inline elements don't. Block elements are not allowed inside inline elements.

Block: div, h1-h6, p, ol, ul, header, nav, main, footer, article, section, aside

Inline: span, a, img, b, i, strong

Use id="name" to name tags.

Global, local and contextual navigation.

Imagine a user is dropped in the middle of your site, how easy is it to navigate around?

Support: sticky navigation buttons, back-tracking bread crumbs, site map, search system, guide.

Contextual links text should be descriptive.

Labels: title, headers, link names, noun = content, verb = function.

Icons look good but can be hard to interpret.

 <b>Strategy plane</b>

What do we want? What do our users want?

Analyse purpose, goals and needs. Prepare for requirements specification.

Who are the users? What goals do they have? What do we need to know about them?

Analyse similar websites. Interview customer and users

**Week 4

Requirements specification, CSS, cascade, id, class.

Chapters LWD 11-13, EUE 4.

Task 3: analysis, requirements specification, documentation.

**Week 5

Information architecture, interaction design, information design, structure, layout.

Chapters LWD 14-16, EUE 5.

Task 3: requirements specification, structure, evaluation & testing, documentation.

**Week 6

UI, responsive design.

Chapters 16-19, EUE 6.

Task 3: structure, navigation, layout, evaluation % testing, documentation.

Deadline task 2.

**Week 7

Pictures, colors, font, style guide.

Chapters LWD 7, 13, 23-24, EUE 7.

Task 3: structure, navigation, layout, website looks, evaluation % testing, documentation.

**Week 8

Tables, forms, other media (sound, video, embedded external information).

Chapters LWD 8-10, 18-19, EUE 8.

Task 3: navigation, layout, website looks, evaluation % testing, documentation.

**Week 9

Task 3: website looks, evaluation % testing, documentation.

Deadline task 3.
