Matthew 1:1-25
Mt 1:1-17,0,18-25
[1]Roll of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:
[1]Amasekuruza ya Yesu Kristo, mwene Dawidi, mwene Aburahamu ngaya:
[2]Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers,

[5]Salmon fathered Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse;
[5]Salumoni yabyaye Bowazi kuri Rahabu, Bowazi yabyaye Obedi kuri Rusi, Obedi yabyaye Yesayi,
[6]and Jesse fathered King David. David fathered Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife,
[6]Yesayi yabyaye Umwami Dawidi.Dawidi yabyaye Salomo kuri muka Uriya,
[7]Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, Abijah fathered Asa,
[7]Salomo yabyaye Rehobowamu, Rehobowamu yabyaye Abiya, Abiya yabyaye Asa,
[8]Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, Joram fathered Uzziah,
[8]Asa yabyaye Yehoshafati, Yehoshafati yabyaye Yoramu, Yoramu yabyaye Uziya,
[9]Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,
[9]Uziya yabyaye Yotamu, Yotamu yabyaye Ahazi, Ahazi yabyaye Hezekiya,
[10]Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amon, Amon fathered Josiah;
[10]Hezekiya yabyaye Manase, Manase yabyaye Amoni, Amoni yabyaye Yosiya,
[11]and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers. Then the deportation to Babylon took place.
[11]Yosiya yabyaye Yekoniya na bene se, igihe bimuriwe i Babuloni.
[12]After the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah fathered Shealtiel, Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel,
[12]Bamaze kwimurirwa i Babuloni, Yekoniya yabyaye Shalutiyeli, Shalutiyeli yabyaye Zerubabeli,
[13]Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, Eliakim fathered Azor,
[13]Zerubabeli yabyaye Abihudi, Abihudi yabyaye Eliyakimu, Eliyakimu yabyaye Azori,
[14]Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, Achim fathered Eliud,
[14]Azori yabyaye Sadoki, Sadoki yabyaye Akimu, Akimu yabyaye Elihudi,
[15]Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, Matthan fathered Jacob;
[15]Elihudi yabyaye Eleyazari, Eleyazari yabyaye Matani, Matani yabyaye Yakobo,
[16]and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary; of her was born Jesus who is called Christ.
[16]Yakobo yabyaye Yosefu umugabo wa Mariya, ari we nyina wa Yesu witwa Kristo.
[17]The sum of generations is therefore: fourteen from Abraham to David; fourteen from David to the Babylonian deportation; and fourteen from the Babylonian deportation to Christ.
[17]Nuko ba sekuruza bose, uhereye kuri Aburahamu ukageza kuri Dawidi ni cumi na bane, kandi uhereye kuri Dawidi ukageza igihe bimuriwe i Babuloni ni cumi na bane, kandi uhereye icyo gihe bimuriwe i Babuloni ukageza kuri Kristo ni cumi na bane. [0]Kuvuka kwa Yesu, uko kwagenze
[18]This is how Jesus Christ came to be born. His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph; but before they came to live together she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
[18]Kuvuka kwa Yesu Kristo kwagenze gutya. Nyina Mariya yari yarasabwe na Yosefu, ariko yari ataramurongora, babona afite inda y'Umwuka Wera.
[19]Her husband Joseph, being an upright man and wanting to spare her disgrace, decided to divorce her informally.
[19]Umugabo we Yosefu kuko yari umukiranutsi kandi adashaka kumukoza isoni ku mugaragaro, yigira inama yo kumubenga rwihishwa.
[20]He had made up his mind to do this when suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, 'Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because she has conceived what is in her by the Holy Spirit.
[20]Akibitekereza, marayika w'Umwami Imana amubonekera mu nzozi ati “Yosefu mwene Dawidi, witinya kurongora umugeni wawe Mariya, kuko imbuto imurimo ari iy'Umwuka Wera.
[21]She will give birth to a son and you must name him Jesus, because he is the one who is to save his people from their sins.'
[21]Azabyara umuhungu uzamwite YESU, kuko ari we uzakiza abantu be ibyaha byabo.”
[22]Now all this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:
[22]Nuko ibyo byose byabereyeho kugira ngo ibyo Umwami Imana yavugiye mu kanwa k'umuhanuzi bisohore ngo
[23]Look! the virgin is with child and will give birth to a son whom they will call Immanuel, a name which means 'God-is-with-us'.
[23]“Dore umwari azasama inda kandi azabyara umuhungu,Azitwa Imanweli”,risobanurwa ngo “Imana iri kumwe natwe”.
[24]When Joseph woke up he did what the angel of the Lord had told him to do: he took his wife to his home;
[24]Yosefu akangutse abigenza uko marayika w'Umwami Imana yamutegetse, arongora umugeni we.
[25]he had not had intercourse with her when she gave birth to a son; and he named him Jesus.
[25]Ariko ntibaryamana arinda ageza igihe yabyariye umuhungu, amwita YESU.

Matthew 2:1-23
Mt 2:1-23
[1]After Jesus had been born at Bethlehem in Judaea during the reign of King Herod, suddenly some wise men came to Jerusalem from the east
[1]Yesu amaze kuvukira i Betelehemu mu gihugu cy'i Yudaya ku ngoma y'Umwami Herode, haza abanyabwenge baturutse iburasirazuba bajya i Yerusalemu, barabaza bati
[2]asking, 'Where is the infant king of the Jews? We saw his star as it rose and have come to do him homage.'
[2]“Umwami w'Abayuda wavutse ari hehe? Ko twabonye inyenyeri ye turi iburasirazuba, none tukaba tuje kumuramya.”
[3]When King Herod heard this he was perturbed, and so was the whole of Jerusalem.
[3]Umwami Herode abyumvise ahagarikana umutima n'ab'i Yerusalemu bose,
[4]He called together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and enquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
[4]ateranya abatambyi bakuru n'abanditsi bose b'ubwo bwoko, ababaza aho Kristo azavukira aho ari ho.
[5]They told him, 'At Bethlehem in Judaea, for this is what the prophet wrote:
[5]Bati “Ni i Betelehemu mu gihugu cy'i Yudaya. Ni ko byanditswe n'umuhanuzi ngo
[6]And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the leaders of Judah, for from you will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.'
[6]‘Nawe Betelehemu ho mu gihugu cya Yuda,Ni ukuri nturi mutoya mu midugudu ikomeye ya Yuda,Kuko muri wowe ari ho hazaturuka umutware,Uzaragira ubwoko bwanjye bw'Abisirayeli.’ ”
[7]Then Herod summoned the wise men to see him privately. He asked them the exact date on which the star had appeared
[7]Nuko Herode ahamagara abanyabwenge rwihishwa, abasobanuza neza igihe baboneye ya nyenyeri,
[8]and sent them on to Bethlehem with the words, 'Go and find out all about the child, and when you have found him, let me know, so that I too may go and do him homage.'
[8]abatuma i Betelehemu ati “Nimugende musobanuze neza iby'uwo mwana. Nimumubona muze mubimbwire, nanjye njye kumuramya.”
[9]Having listened to what the king had to say, they set out. And suddenly the star they had seen rising went forward and halted over the place where the child was.
[9]Bamaze kumva umwami baragenda, kandi ya nyenyeri babonye bakiri iburasirazuba ibajya imbere, irinda igera aho uwo mwana ari ihagarara aho.
[10]The sight of the star filled them with delight,
[10]Babonye iyo nyenyeri baranezerwa cyane.
[11]and going into the house they saw the child with his mother Mary, and falling to their knees they did him homage. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.
[11]Bageze mu nzu basangamo umwana hamwe na nyina Mariya, barapfukama baramuramya. Maze bahambura imitwaro yabo, bamutura amaturo y'izahabu n'icyome n'ishangi.
[12]But they were given a warning in a dream not to go back to Herod, and returned to their own country by a different way.
[12]Baburizwa n'Imana mu nzozi gusubira kwa Herode, banyura iyindi nzira basubira iwabo.
[13]After they had left, suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with you, and escape into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and do away with him.'
[13]Bamaze kugenda marayika w'Umwami Imana araza, abonekera Yosefu mu nzozi ati “Byuka ujyane umwana na nyina uhungire muri Egiputa, ugumeyo ugeze aho nzakubwirira, kuko Herode agenza umwana ngo amwice.”
[14]So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him, left that night for Egypt,
[14]Na we aherako arabyuka ajyana umwana na nyina nijoro, ajya muri Egiputa,
[15]where he stayed until Herod was dead. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: I called my son out of Egypt.
[15]agumayo ageza ubwo Herode amaze gutanga, ngo ibyo Umwami Imana yavugiye mu kanwa k'umuhanuzi bisohore ngo “Nahamagaye umwana wanjye ngo ave muri Egiputa.”
[16]Herod was furious on realising that he had been fooled by the wise men, and in Bethlehem and its surrounding district he had all the male children killed who were two years old or less, reckoning by the date he had been careful to ask the wise men.
[16]Herode abonye ko yatengushywe na ba banyabwenge ararakara cyane, aratuma ngo bice abana b'abahungu bose bari i Betelehemu no mu misozi yose iri bugufi bwaho, bamaze imyaka ibiri n'abatarayimara, nk'uko yagereranyije igihe yasobanuriwe n'abo banyabwenge.
[17]Then were fulfilled the words spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:
[17]Ni bwo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yeremiya byasohoye ngo
[18]A voice is heard in Ramah, lamenting and weeping bitterly: it is Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted because they are no more.
[18]“Induru yumvikaniye i Rama,Yo kurira no kuboroga kwinshi,Rasheli aririra abana be,Yanga guhozwa kuko batakiriho.”
[19]After Herod's death, suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
[19]Herode amaze gupfa, marayika w'Umwami Imana araza, abonekera Yosefu mu nzozi ari mu Egiputa ati
[20]and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with you and go back to the land of Israel, for those who wanted to kill the child are dead.'
[20]“Byuka usubize umwana na nyina mu gihugu cya Isirayeli, kuko abashakaga kumwica bapfuye.”
[21]So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him, went back to the land of Israel.
[21]Arabyuka ajyana umwana na nyina, asubira mu gihugu cya Isirayeli.
[22]But when he learnt that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as ruler of Judaea he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
[22]Ariko yumvise yuko Arikelayo yimye i Yudaya aha se Herode atinya kujyayo, abwirizwa n'Imana mu nzozi ajya mu gihugu cy'i Galilaya,
[23]There he settled in a town called Nazareth. In this way the words spoken through the prophets were to be fulfilled: He will be called a Nazarene.
[23]atura mu mudugudu witwa i Nazareti ngo ibyavuzwe n'abahanuzi bisohore ngo “Azitwa Umunazareti.”

Matthew 3:1-17
Mt 3:1-17
[1]In due course John the Baptist appeared; he proclaimed this message in the desert of Judaea,
[1]Icyo gihe Yohana Umubatiza araza, yigishiriza mu butayu bw'i Yudaya ati
[2]'Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is close at hand.'
[2]“Mwihane kuko ubwami bwo mu ijuru buri hafi.”
[3]This was the man spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said: A voice of one that cries in the desert, 'Prepare a way for the Lord, make his paths straight.'
[3]Kandi ni we wavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yesaya ngo“Ijwi ry'urangururira mu butayu ati‘Nimutunganye inzira y'Uwiteka,Mugorore inzira ze.’ ”
[4]This man John wore a garment made of camel-hair with a leather loin-cloth round his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
[4]Yohana uwo yari yambaye umwambaro w'ubwoya bw'ingamiya, abukenyeje umushumi, ibyokurya bye byari inzige n'ubuki bw'ubuhura.
[5]Then Jerusalem and all Judaea and the whole Jordan district made their way to him,
[5]Maze ab'i Yerusalemu n'ab'i Yudaya yose, no mu gihugu cyose giteganye na Yorodani bose barahaguruka bajya aho ari,
[6]and as they were baptised by him in the river Jordan they confessed their sins.
[6]ababatiriza mu ruzi rwa Yorodani bavuga ibyaha bakoze.
[7]But when he saw a number of Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism he said to them, 'Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming retribution?
[7]Abonye Abafarisayo n'Abasadukayo benshi bazanywe no kubatizwa arababaza ati “Mwa bana b'incira mwe, ni nde wababuriye ngo muhunge umujinya uzatera?
[8]Produce fruit in keeping with repentance,
[8]Nuko mwere imbuto zikwiriye abihannye.
[9]and do not presume to tell yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father," because, I tell you, God can raise children for Abraham from these stones.
[9]Ntimukibwire muti ‘Dufite Aburahamu, ni we sogokuruza.’ Ndababwira yuko Imana ibasha guhindurira Aburahamu abana muri aya mabuye.
[10]Even now the axe is being laid to the root of the trees, so that any tree failing to produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown on the fire.
[10]Ndetse ubu intorezo igezwe ku bishyitsi by'ibiti, nuko igiti cyose kitera imbuto nziza kizacibwa, kijugunywe mu muriro.
[11]I baptise you in water for repentance, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit to carry his sandals; he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
[11]Jyeweho ndababatirisha amazi ngo mwihane, ariko uzaza hanyuma yanjye andusha ubushobozi, ntibinkwiriye no kumutwaza inkweto. Ni we uzababatirisha Umwuka Wera n'umuriro,
[12]His winnowing-fan is in his hand; he will clear his threshing-floor and gather his wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn in a fire that will never go out.'
[12]intara ye iri mu kuboko kwe kandi azeza imbuga ye cyane, amasaka ye azayahunika mu kigega, ariko umurama wo azawucanisha umuriro utazima.”
[13]Then Jesus appeared: he came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptised by John.
[13]Icyo gihe Yesu ava i Galilaya ajya kuri Yorodani, asanga Yohana ngo amubatize.
[14]John tried to dissuade him, with the words, 'It is I who need baptism from you, and yet you come to me!'
[14]Na we ashaka kumuhakanira ati “Ko ari jye wari ukwiriye kubatizwa nawe, none ni wowe unsanze?”
[15]But Jesus replied, 'Leave it like this for the time being; it is fitting that we should, in this way, do all that uprightness demands.' Then John gave in to him.
[15]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Emera ubikore, kuko ari byo bidukwiriye ngo dusohoze gukiranuka kose.” Aherako aremera.
[16]And when Jesus had been baptised he at once came up from the water, and suddenly the heavens opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming down on him.
[16]Yesu amaze kubatizwa uwo mwanya ava mu mazi, ijuru riramukingukira abona Umwuka w'Imana amanuka asa n'inuma amujyaho,
[17]And suddenly there was a voice from heaven, 'This is my Son, the Beloved; my favour rests on him.'
[17]maze ijwi rivugira mu ijuru riti “Nguyu Umwana wanjye nkunda nkamwishimira.” Luka 9.35

Matthew 4:1-25
Mt 4:1-17,0,18-25
[1]Then Jesus was led by the Spirit out into the desert to be put to the test by the devil.
[1]Maze Yesu ajyanwa n'Umwuka mu butayu kugeragezwa n'umwanzi,
[2]He fasted for forty days and forty nights, after which he was hungry,
[2]amaze iminsi mirongo ine n'amajoro mirongo ine atarya, abona gusonza.
[3]and the tester came and said to him, 'If you are Son of God, tell these stones to turn into loaves.'
[3]Umushukanyi aramwegera aramubwira ati “Niba uri Umwana w'Imana, bwira aya mabuye ahinduke imitsima.”
[4]But he replied, 'Scripture says: Human beings live not on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'
[4]Aramusubiza ati “Handitswe ngo ‘Umuntu ntatungwa n'umutsima gusa, ahubwo atungwa n'amagambo yose ava mu kanwa k'Imana.’ ”
[5]The devil then took him to the holy city and set him on the parapet of the Temple.
[5]Maze umwanzi amujyana ku murwa wera, amuhagarika ku gasongero k'urusengero
[6]'If you are Son of God,' he said, 'throw yourself down; for scripture says: He has given his angels orders about you, and they will carry you in their arms in case you trip over a stone.'
[6]aramubwira ati “Niba uri Umwana w'Imana, ijugunye hasi kuko handitswe ngo‘Izagutegekera abamarayika bayo,Bakuramire mu maboko yabo,Ngo udakubita ikirenge ku ibuye.’ ”
[7]Jesus said to him, 'Scripture also says: Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'
[7]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Kandi handitswe ngo ‘Ntukagerageze Uwiteka Imana yawe.’ ”
[8]Next, taking him to a very high mountain, the devil showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour.
[8]Umwanzi arongera amujyana mu mpinga y'umusozi muremure cyane, amwereka ubwami bwose bwo mu isi n'ubwiza bwabwo
[9]And he said to him, 'I will give you all these, if you fall at my feet and do me homage.'
[9]aramubwira ati “Biriya byose ndabiguha nupfukama ukandamya.”
[10]Then Jesus replied, 'Away with you, Satan! For scripture says: The Lord your God is the one to whom you must do homage, him alone you must serve.'
[10]Yesu aramubwira ati “Genda Satani, kuko handitswe ngo ‘Uramye Uwiteka Imana yawe, abe ari yo ukorera yonyine.’ ”
[11]Then the devil left him, and suddenly angels appeared and looked after him.
[11]Umwanzi aherako aramureka, maze haza abamarayika baramukorera.
[12]Hearing that John had been arrested he withdrew to Galilee,
[12]Yesu yumvise ko babohesheje Yohana, aragenda ajya i Galilaya.
[13]and leaving Nazara he went and settled in Capernaum, beside the lake, on the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali.
[13]Yimuka i Nazareti atura i Kaperinawumu, umudugudu uri ku nyanja mu rugabano rwa Zebuluni na Nafutali,
[14]This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
[14]ngo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yesaya bisohore ngo
[15]Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Way of the sea beyond Jordan. Galilee of the nations!
[15]“Mu gihugu cya Zebuluni na Nafutali,Hafi y'inyanja hakurya ya Yorodani,N'i Galilaya y'abapagani,
[16]The people that lived in darkness have seen a great light; on those who lived in a country of shadow dark as death a light has dawned.
[16]Abantu bari bicaye mu mwijima babonye umucyo mwinshi,kandi abari bicaye mu gihugu cy'urupfu no mu gicucu cyarwo,Bamurikirwa n'umucyo.”
[17]From then onwards Jesus began his proclamation with the message, 'Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is close at hand.'
[17]Yesu ahera ubwo atangira kwigisha avuga ati “Mwihane kuko ubwami bwo mu ijuru buri hafi.” [0](Mar 1.16-20; Luka 5.1-11; Yoh 1.35-42)
[18]As he was walking by the Lake of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter, and his brother Andrew; they were making a cast into the lake with their net, for they were fishermen.
[18]Agenda iruhande rw'inyanja y'i Galilaya abona abavandimwe babiri, Simoni witwaga Petero na Andereya mwene se, barobesha urushundura mu nyanja kuko bari abarobyi.
[19]And he said to them, 'Come after me and I will make you fishers of people.'
[19]Arababwira ati “Nimunkurikire nzabagire abarobyi b'abantu.”
[20]And at once they left their nets and followed him.
[20]Uwo mwanya basiga inshundura baramukurikira.
[21]Going on from there he saw another pair of brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John; they were in their boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.
[21]Yicumye imbere abona abandi bavandimwe babiri, umwe ni Yakobo mwene Zebedayo na Yohana mwene se, bari mu bwato hamwe na se Zebedayo bapfundikanya inshundura zabo, arabahamagara.
[22]And at once, leaving the boat and their father, they followed him.
[22]Uwo mwanya basiga ubwato na se, baramukurikira.
[23]He went round the whole of Galilee teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing all kinds of disease and illness among the people.
[23]Yesu agenderera ab'i Galilaya hose, abigishiriza mu masinagogi yabo ababwira ubutumwa bwiza bw'ubwami, akiza n'indwara zose n'ubumuga bw'abantu.
[24]His fame spread throughout Syria, and those who were suffering from diseases and painful complaints of one kind or another, the possessed, epileptics, the paralysed, were all brought to him, and he cured them.
[24]Inkuru ye yamamara i Siriya yose, bamuzanira abarwayi bose n'indembe barwaye indwara zitari zimwe, n'abatewe n'abadayimoni, n'abarwaye ibicuri n'ibirema arabakiza.
[25]Large crowds followed him, coming from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judaea and Transjordan.
[25]Abantu benshi baramukurikira bavuye i Galilaya n'i Dekapoli, n'i Yerusalemu n'i Yudaya no hakurya ya Yorodani.

Matthew 5:1-48
Mt 5:1-48
[1]Seeing the crowds, he went onto the mountain. And when he was seated his disciples came to him.
[1]Abonye abantu benshi azamuka umusozi, maze kwicara abigishwa be baramwegera.
[2]Then he began to speak. This is what he taught them:
[2]Aterura amagambo ati
[3]How blessed are the poor in spirit: the kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
[3]“Hahirwa abakene mu mitima yabo,Kuko ubwami bwo mu ijuru ari ubwabo.
[4]Blessed are the gentle: they shall have the earth as inheritance.
[4]Hahirwa abashavura,Kuko ari bo bazahozwa.
[5]Blessed are those who mourn: they shall be comforted.
[5]Hahirwa abagwa neza,Kuko ari bo bazahabwa isi.
[6]Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for uprightness: they shall have their fill.
[6]Hahirwa abafite inzara n'inyota byo gukiranuka,Kuko ari bo bazahazwa.
[7]Blessed are the merciful: they shall have mercy shown them.
[7]Hahirwa abanyambabazi,Kuko ari bo bazazigirirwa.
[8]Blessed are the pure in heart: they shall see God.
[8]Hahirwa ab'imitima iboneye,Kuko ari bo bazabona Imana.
[9]Blessed are the peacemakers: they shall be recognised as children of God.
[9]Hahirwa abakiranura,Kuko ari bo bazitwa abana b'Imana.
[10]Blessed are those who are persecuted in the cause of uprightness: the kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
[10]Hahirwa abarenganyirijwe gukiranuka,Kuko ubwami bwo mu ijuru ari ubwabo.
[11]'Blessed are you when people abuse you and persecute you and speak all kinds of calumny against you falsely on my account.
[11]“Namwe muzahirwa ubwo bazabatuka bakabarenganya, bakababeshyera ibibi byinshi babampora.
[12]Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven; this is how they persecuted the prophets before you.
[12]Muzanezerwe, muzishime cyane kuko ingororano zanyu ari nyinshi mu ijuru, kuko ari ko barenganyije abahanuzi ba mbere.
[13]'You are salt for the earth. But if salt loses its taste, what can make it salty again? It is good for nothing, and can only be thrown out to be trampled under people's feet.
[13]“Muri umunyu w'isi. Mbese umunyu nukayuka uzaryoshywa n'iki? Nta cyo uba ukimaze keretse kujugunywa hanze, abantu bakawukandagira.
[14]'You are light for the world. A city built on a hill-top cannot be hidden.
[14]“Muri umucyo w'isi. Umudugudu wubatswe ku mpinga y'umusozi ntubasha kwihisha.
[15]No one lights a lamp to put it under a tub; they put it on the lamp-stand where it shines for everyone in the house.
[15]Nta bakongeza itabaza ngo baritwikirize intonga, ahubwo barishyira ku gitereko cyaryo rikamurikira abari mu nzu bose.
[16]In the same way your light must shine in people's sight, so that, seeing your good works, they may give praise to your Father in heaven.
[16]Abe ari ko umucyo wanyu ubonekera imbere y'abantu, kugira ngo babone imirimo yanyu myiza, bahereko bahimbaze So wo mu ijuru.
[17]'Do not imagine that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have come not to abolish but to complete them.
[17]“Mwitekereza ko naje gukuraho amategeko cyangwa ibyahanuwe. Sinaje kubikuraho, ahubwo naje kubisohoza.
[18]In truth I tell you, till heaven and earth disappear, not one dot, not one little stroke, is to disappear from the Law until all its purpose is achieved.
[18]Kandi ndababwira ukuri yuko ijuru n'isi kugeza aho bizashirira, amategeko atazavaho inyuguti imwe cyangwa agace kayo gato, kugeza aho byose bizarangirira.
[19]Therefore, anyone who infringes even one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be considered the least in the kingdom of Heaven; but the person who keeps them and teaches them will be considered great in the kingdom of Heaven.
[19]Nuko uzica rimwe ryo muri ayo mategeko naho ryaba ryoroshye hanyuma y'ayandi, akigisha abandi kugira batyo, mu bwami bwo mu ijuru azitwa mutoya rwose. Ariko uzayakora akayigisha abandi, mu bwami bwo mu ijuru azitwa mukuru.
[20]'For I tell you, if your uprightness does not surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never get into the kingdom of Heaven.
[20]Kandi ndababwira yuko gukiranuka kwanyu nikutaruta ukw'abanditsi n'ukw'Abafarisayo, mutazinjira mu bwami bwo mu ijuru.
[21]'You have heard how it was said to our ancestors, You shall not kill; and if anyone does kill he must answer for it before the court.
[21]“Mwumvise ko abakera babwiwe ngo ‘Ntukice, uwica akwiriye guhanwa n'abacamanza.’
[22]But I say this to you, anyone who is angry with a brother will answer for it before the court; anyone who calls a brother "Fool" will answer for it before the Sanhedrin; and anyone who calls him "Traitor" will answer for it in hell fire.
[22]Ariko jyeweho ndababwira yuko umuntu wese urakarira mwene se akwiriye guhanwa n'abacamanza, uzatuka mwene se ati ‘Wa mupfu we’, akwiriye guhanirwa mu rukiko, uzabwira mwene se ati ‘Wa gicucu we’, akwiriye gushyirwa mu muriro w'i Gehinomu.
[23]So then, if you are bringing your offering to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
[23]Nuko nujyana ituro ryawe ku gicaniro, ukahibukira mwene so ko afite icyo mupfa,
[24]leave your offering there before the altar, go and be reconciled with your brother first, and then come back and present your offering.
[24]usige ituro ryawe imbere y'igicaniro ubanze ugende wikiranure na mwene so, uhereko ugaruke uture ituro ryawe.
[25]Come to terms with your opponent in good time while you are still on the way to the court with him, or he may hand you over to the judge and the judge to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison.
[25]“Wikiranure vuba n'ukurega mukiri mu nzira, ukurega ye kugushyikiriza umucamanza, umucamanza ataguha umusirikare akagushyira mu nzu y'imbohe.
[26]In truth I tell you, you will not get out till you have paid the last penny.
[26]Ndakubwira ukuri yuko utazavamo rwose, keretse wishyuye umwenda wose hadasigaye ikuta na rimwe.
[27]'You have heard how it was said, You shall not commit adultery.
[27]“Mwumvise ko byavuzwe ngo ‘Ntugasambane.’
[28]But I say this to you, if a man looks at a woman lustfully, he has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
[28]Jyeweho ndababwira yuko umuntu wese ureba umugore akamwifuza, aba amaze gusambana na we mu mutima we.
[29]If your right eye should be your downfall, tear it out and throw it away; for it will do you less harm to lose one part of yourself than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
[29]Ijisho ryawe ry'iburyo nirigushuka rikakugusha, urinogore urite kure. Ibyiza ni uko wapfa ijisho rimwe, biruta ko umubiri wawe wose wajugunywa muri Gehinomu.
[30]And if your right hand should be your downfall, cut it off and throw it away; for it will do you less harm to lose one part of yourself than to have your whole body go to hell.
[30]N'ikiganza cyawe cy'iburyo nikikugusha, ugice ugite kure. Ibyiza ni uko wabura urugingo rwawe rumwe, biruta ko umubiri wawe wose wajugunywa muri Gehinomu.
[31]'It has also been said, Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a writ of dismissal.
[31]“Kandi byaravuzwe ngo ‘Uzasenda umugore we, amuhe urwandiko rwo kumusenda.’
[32]But I say this to you, everyone who divorces his wife, except for the case of an illicit marriage, makes her an adulteress; and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
[32]Ariko jyeweho ndababwira yuko umuntu wese usenda umugore we atamuhora gusambana, aba amuteye gusambana, kandi uzacyura uwasenzwe azaba asambanye.
[33]'Again, you have heard how it was said to our ancestors, You must not break your oath, but must fulfil your oaths to the Lord.
[33]“Kandi mwumvise ko abakera babwiwe ngo ‘Ntukarahire ibinyoma, ahubwo uzakorere Umwami Imana ibyo wayirahiye.’
[34]But I say this to you, do not swear at all, either by heaven, since that is God's throne;
[34]Ariko jyeweho ndababwira kutarahira rwose, naho ryaba ijuru kuko ari ryo ntebe y'Imana,
[35]or by earth, since that is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, since that is the city of the great King.
[35]cyangwa isi kuko ari yo ntebe y'ibirenge byayo, cyangwa i Yerusalemu kuko ari ururembo rw'Umwami ukomeye.
[36]Do not swear by your own head either, since you cannot turn a single hair white or black.
[36]Kandi ntuzarahire umutwe wawe, kuko utabasha kweza agasatsi kamwe cyangwa ngo ukīrabuze.
[37]All you need say is "Yes" if you mean yes, "No" if you mean no; anything more than this comes from the Evil One.
[37]Ahubwo ijambo ryanyu ribe ‘Yee, Yee’, ‘Oya, Oya’, ibirenze ibyo bituruka ku Mubi.
[38]'You have heard how it was said: Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.
[38]“Mwumvise ko byavuzwe ngo ‘Ijisho rihōrerwe irindi, n'iryinyo rihōrerwe irindi.’
[39]But I say this to you: offer no resistance to the wicked. On the contrary, if anyone hits you on the right cheek, offer him the other as well;
[39]Ariko jyeweho ndababwira kutabuza umuntu mubi kubagirira nabi: ugukubise urushyi mu musaya w'iburyo, umuhindurire n'uw'ibumoso,
[40]if someone wishes to go to law with you to get your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
[40]umuntu nashaka kukuburanya ngo agutware ikanzu yawe, umuhe n'umwitero,
[41]And if anyone requires you to go one mile, go two miles with him.
[41]ugutegetse kujyana na we mu gikingi kimwe, umujyane no mu cya kabiri.
[42]Give to anyone who asks you, and if anyone wants to borrow, do not turn away.
[42]Ukwaka umuhe kandi ushaka kugutira ntumwerekeze umugongo.
[43]'You have heard how it was said, You will love your neighbour and hate your enemy.
[43]“Mwumvise ko byavuzwe ngo ‘Ukunde mugenzi wawe, wange umwanzi wawe.’
[44]But I say this to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you;
[44]Ariko jyeweho ndababwira nti ‘Mukunde abanzi banyu, musabire ababarenganya,
[45]so that you may be children of your Father in heaven, for he causes his sun to rise on the bad as well as the good, and sends down rain to fall on the upright and the wicked alike.
[45]ni bwo muzaba abana ba So wo mu ijuru, kuko ategeka izuba rye kurasira ababi n'abeza, kandi abakiranuka n'abakiranirwa abavubira imvura.
[46]For if you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Do not even the tax collectors do as much?
[46]Nimukunda ababakunda gusa, muzahembwa iki? Mbese abakoresha ikoro na bo ntibagira batyo?
[47]And if you save your greetings for your brothers, are you doing anything exceptional?
[47]Nimuramutsa bene wanyu bonyine, abandi mubarusha iki? Mbese abapagani na bo ntibagira batyo?
[48]Do not even the gentiles do as much? You must therefore be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.'
[48]Namwe mube mukiranutse nk'uko So wo mu ijuru akiranuka.

Matthew 6:1-34
Mt 6:1-34
[1]'Be careful not to parade your uprightness in public to attract attention; otherwise you will lose all reward from your Father in heaven.
[1]“ ‘Mwirinde, ntimugakorere ibyiza byanyu imbere y'abantu kugira ngo babarebe, kuko nimugira mutyo ari nta ngororano muzagororerwa na So wo mu ijuru.
[2]So when you give alms, do not have it trumpeted before you; this is what the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets to win human admiration. In truth I tell you, they have had their reward.
[2]“ ‘Ahubwo nugira ubuntu, ntukavuze ihembe imbere yawe nk'uko indyarya zigira mu masinagogi no mu nzira ngo bashimwe n'abantu. Ndababwira ukuri yuko bamaze kugororerwa ingororano zabo.
[3]But when you give alms, your left hand must not know what your right is doing;
[3]Ahubwo wowe ho nugira ubuntu, ukuboko kwawe kw'ibumoso kwe kumenya icyo ukw'iburyo gukora,
[4]your almsgiving must be secret, and your Father who sees all that is done in secret will reward you.
[4]ahubwo ugire ubuntu bwawe wiherereye. Nuko So ureba ibyiherereye azakugororera.
[5]'And when you pray, do not imitate the hypocrites: they love to say their prayers standing up in the synagogues and at the street corners for people to see them. In truth I tell you, they have had their reward.
[5]“ ‘Nimusenga ntimukamere nk'indyarya, kuko bakunda gusenga bahagaze mu masinagogi no mu nzira ngo abantu babarebe. Ndababwira ukuri yuko bamaze kugororerwa ingororano zabo.
[6]But when you pray, go to your private room, shut yourself in, and so pray to your Father who is in that secret place, and your Father who sees all that is done in secret will reward you.
[6]Wehoho nusenga ujye winjira mu nzu ubanze ukinge urugi, uhereko usenge So mwihereranye. Nuko So ureba ibyiherereye azakugororera.
[7]'In your prayers do not babble as the gentiles do, for they think that by using many words they will make themselves heard.
[7]“ ‘Namwe nimusenga, ntimukavuge amagambo muyasubiramo hato na hato nk'uko abapagani bagira, bibwira ko kuvuga amagambo menshi ari byo bituma bumvirwa.
[8]Do not be like them; your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
[8]Nuko ntimugase na bo, kuko So azi ibyo mukennye mutaramusaba.
[9]So you should pray like this: Our Father in heaven, may your name be held holy,
[9]Nuko musenge mutya muti“ ‘Data wa twese uri mu ijuru,Izina ryawe ryubahwe,
[10]your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as in heaven.
[10]Ubwami bwawe buze,Ibyo ushaka bibeho mu isi,Nk'uko biba mu ijuru.
[11]Give us today our daily bread.
[11]Uduhe none ibyokurya byacu by'uyu munsi,
[12]And forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven those who are in debt to us.
[12]Uduharire imyenda yacu,Nk'uko natwe twahariye abarimo imyenda yacu,
[13]And do not put us to the test, but save us from the Evil One.
[13]Ntuduhāne mu bitwoshya,Ahubwo udukize Umubi,Kuko ubwami n'ubushobozi n'icyubahiro ari ibyawe,None n'iteka ryose. Amen. ’
[14]'Yes, if you forgive others their failings, your heavenly Father will forgive you yours;
[14]“Kuko nimubabarira abantu ibyaha byabo, na So wo mu ijuru azabababarira namwe,
[15]but if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive your failings either.
[15]ariko nimutababarira abantu, na So na we ntazabababarira ibyaha byanyu.
[16]'When you are fasting, do not put on a gloomy look as the hypocrites do: they go about looking unsightly to let people know they are fasting. In truth I tell you, they have had their reward.
[16]“Kandi nimwiyiriza ubusa ntimukabe nk'indyarya zigaragaza umubabaro, kuko bagaragaza umubabaro kugira ngo abantu babarebe ko biyirije ubusa. Ndababwira ukuri yuko bamaze kugororerwa ingororano zabo.
[17]But when you fast, put scent on your head and wash your face,
[17]Ariko weho niwiyiriza ubusa wisige amavuta mu mutwe, wiyuhagire mu maso,
[18]so that no one will know you are fasting except your Father who sees all that is done in secret; and your Father who sees all that is done in secret will reward you.
[18]kugira ngo abantu batamenya ko wiyirije ubusa keretse So uri ahiherereye, kandi So ureba ibyiherereye azakugororera.
[19]'Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and woodworm destroy them and thieves can break in and steal.
[19]“Ntimukībikire ubutunzi mu isi, aho inyenzi n'ingese ziburya, kandi abajura bacukura bakabwiba.
[20]But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor woodworm destroys them and thieves cannot break in and steal.
[20]Ahubwo mwibikire ubutunzi mu ijuru, aho inyenzi n'ingese zitaburya, n'abajura ntibacukure ngo babwibe,
[21]For wherever your treasure is, there will your heart be too.
[21]kuko aho ubutunzi bwawe buri ari ho n'umutima wawe uzaba.
[22]'The lamp of the body is the eye. It follows that if your eye is clear, your whole body will be filled with light.
[22]“Itabaza ry'umubiri ni ijisho. Ijisho ryawe nirireba neza, umubiri wawe wose uba ufite umucyo,
[23]But if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be darkness. If then, the light inside you is darkened, what darkness that will be!
[23]ariko niriba ribi, umubiri wawe wose uba ufite umwijima. Nuko umucyo ukurimo nuba umwijima, mbega uwo mwijima uko uba ari mwinshi!
[24]'No one can be the slave of two masters: he will either hate the first and love the second, or be attached to the first and despise the second. You cannot be the slave both of God and of money.
[24]“Nta wucyeza abami babiri kuko yakwanga umwe agakunda undi, cyangwa yaguma kuri umwe agasuzugura undi. Ntimubasha gukorera Imana n'ubutunzi.
[25]'That is why I am telling you not to worry about your life and what you are to eat, nor about your body and what you are to wear. Surely life is more than food, and the body more than clothing!
[25]“Ni cyo gitumye mbabwira nti: ntimukiganyire ngo mutekereze ubugingo muti ‘Tuzarya iki?’ Cyangwa muti ‘Tuzanywa iki?’ Ntimwiganyire ngo mutekereze iby'umubiri wanyu ngo ‘Tuzambara iki?’ Mbese ubugingo ntiburuta ibyokurya, umubiri nturuta imyambaro?
[26]Look at the birds in the sky. They do not sow or reap or gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they are?
[26]Nimurebe ibiguruka mu kirere: ntibibiba, ntibisarura, ntibihunika mu bigega, kandi So wo mu ijuru arabigaburira na byo. Mwebwe se ntimubiruta cyane?
[27]Can any of you, however much you worry, add one single cubit to your span of life?
[27]Ni nde muri mwe wiganyira wabasha kwiyunguraho umukono umwe?
[28]And why worry about clothing? Think of the flowers growing in the fields; they never have to work or spin;
[28]“None se ikibaganyisha imyambaro ni iki? Mutekereze uburabyo bwo mu gasozi uko bumera: ntibugira umurimo, ntibuboha imyenda,
[29]yet I assure you that not even Solomon in all his royal robes was clothed like one of these.
[29]kandi ndababwira yuko Salomo mu bwiza bwe bwose, atarimbaga nk'akarabyo kamwe ko muri ubu.
[30]Now if that is how God clothes the wild flowers growing in the field which are there today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, will he not much more look after you, you who have so little faith?
[30]Ariko Imana ubwo yambika ubwatsi bwo mu gasozi ityo, buriho none ejo bakabujugunya mu muriro, ntizarushaho kubambika mwa bafite kwizera guke mwe?
[31]So do not worry; do not say, "What are we to eat? What are we to drink? What are we to wear?"
[31]“Nuko ntimukiganyire mugira ngo ‘Tuzarya iki?’ Cyangwa ngo ‘Tuzanywa iki?’ Cyangwa ngo ‘Tuzambara iki?’
[32]It is the gentiles who set their hearts on all these things. Your heavenly Father knows you need them all.
[32]Kuko ibyo byose abapagani babishaka, kandi So wo mu ijuru azi ko mubikwiriye byose.
[33]Set your hearts on his kingdom first, and on God's saving justice, and all these other things will be given you as well.
[33]Ahubwo mubanze mushake ubwami bw'Imana no gukiranuka kwayo, ni bwo ibyo byose muzabyongerwa.
[34]So do not worry about tomorrow: tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.'
[34]Ntimukiganyire mutekereza iby'ejo, kuko ab'ejo baziganyira iby'ejo. Umunsi wose ukwiranye n'ibibi byawo.

Matthew 7:1-29
Mt 7:1-29
[1]'Do not judge, and you will not be judged;
[1]“Ntimugacire abandi urubanza mu mitima yanyu kugira ngo namwe mutazarucirwa,
[2]because the judgements you give are the judgements you will get, and the standard you use will be the standard used for you.
[2]kuko urubanza muca ari rwo muzacirwa namwe, urugero mugeramo ari rwo muzagererwamo namwe.
[3]Why do you observe the splinter in your brother's eye and never notice the great log in your own?
[3]Ni iki gituma ubona agatotsi kari mu jisho rya mwene so, ariko ntiwite ku mugogo uri mu jisho ryawe?
[4]And how dare you say to your brother, "Let me take that splinter out of your eye," when, look, there is a great log in your own?
[4]Cyangwa wabasha ute kubwira mwene so uti ‘Henga ngutokore agatotsi mu jisho ryawe’, kandi ugifite umugogo mu jisho ryawe?
[5]Hypocrite! Take the log out of your own eye first, and then you will see clearly enough to take the splinter out of your brother's eye.
[5]Wa ndyarya we, banza wikuremo umugogo uri mu ryawe jisho, kuko ari bwo wabona uko utokora agatotsi mu jisho rya mwene so.
[6]'Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls in front of pigs, or they may trample them and then turn on you and tear you to pieces.
[6]“Ibyejejwe by'Imana ntimukabihe imbwa, kandi n'imaragarita zanyu ntimukazite imbere y'ingurube, kugira ngo zitaziribata maze zikabahindukirana zikabarya.
[7]'Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
[7]“Musabe muzahabwa, mushake muzabona, mukomange ku rugi muzakingurirwa.
[8]Everyone who asks receives; everyone who searches finds; everyone who knocks will have the door opened.
[8]Kuko umuntu wese usaba ahabwa, ushatse abona, n'ukomanga agakingurirwa.
[9]Is there anyone among you who would hand his son a stone when he asked for bread?
[9]Mbese muri mwe hari umuntu umwana we yasaba umutsima akamuha ibuye,
[10]Or would hand him a snake when he asked for a fish?
[10]cyangwa yamusaba ifi akamuha inzoka?
[11]If you, then, evil as you are, know how to give your children what is good, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
[11]Ko muri babi kandi mukaba muzi guha abana banyu ibyiza, none So wo mu ijuru ntazarushaho guha ibyiza ababimusabye?
[12]'So always treat others as you would like them to treat you; that is the Law and the Prophets.
[12]“Nuko ibyo mushaka ko abantu babagirira byose mube ari ko mubagirira namwe, kuko ayo ari yo mategeko n'ibyahanuwe.
[13]'Enter by the narrow gate, since the road that leads to destruction is wide and spacious, and many take it;
[13]“Munyure mu irembo rifunganye, kuko irembo ari rigari, n'inzira ijyana abantu kurimbuka ari nini, kandi abayinyuramo ni benshi.
[14]but it is a narrow gate and a hard road that leads to life, and only a few find it.
[14]Ariko irembo rifunganye, n'inzira ijya mu bugingo iraruhije, kandi abayinyuramo ni bake.
[15]'Beware of false prophets who come to you disguised as sheep but underneath are ravenous wolves.
[15]“Mwirinde abahanuzi b'ibinyoma baza aho muri basa n'intama, ariko imbere ari amasega aryana.
[16]You will be able to tell them by their fruits. Can people pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
[16]Muzabamenyera ku mbuto zabo. Mbese hari abasoroma imizabibu ku mugenge, cyangwa imbuto z'umutini ku gitovu?
[17]In the same way, a sound tree produces good fruit but a rotten tree bad fruit.
[17]Nuko igiti cyiza cyose cyera imbuto nziza, ariko igiti kibi cyera imbuto mbi.
[18]A sound tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor a rotten tree bear good fruit.
[18]Igiti cyiza ntikibasha kwera imbuto mbi, kandi n'igiti kibi ntikibasha kwera imbuto nziza.
[19]Any tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown on the fire.
[19]Igiti cyose kitera imbuto nziza kiracibwa, kikajugunywa mu muriro.
[20]I repeat, you will be able to tell them by their fruits.
[20]Nuko muzabamenyera ku mbuto zabo.
[21]'It is not anyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," who will enter the kingdom of Heaven, but the person who does the will of my Father in heaven.
[21]“Umuntu wese umbwira ati ‘Mwami, Mwami’, si we uzinjira mu bwami bwo mu ijuru, keretse ukora ibyo Data wo mu ijuru ashaka.
[22]When the day comes many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, drive out demons in your name, work many miracles in your name?"
[22]Benshi bazambaza kuri uwo munsi bati ‘Mwami, Mwami, ntitwahanuraga mu izina ryawe, ntitwirukanaga abadayimoni mu izina ryawe, ntitwakoraga ibitangaza byinshi mu izina ryawe?’
[23]Then I shall tell them to their faces: I have never known you; away from me, all evil doers!
[23]Ni bwo nzaberurira nti ‘Sinigeze kubamenya, nimumve imbere mwa nkozi z'ibibi mwe.’
[24]'Therefore, everyone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them will be like a sensible man who built his house on rock.
[24]“Nuko umuntu wese wumva ayo magambo yanjye akayakomeza, azaba nk'umunyabwenge wubatse inzu ye ku rutare,
[25]Rain came down, floods rose, gales blew and hurled themselves against that house, and it did not fall: it was founded on rock.
[25]imvura iragwa, imivu iratemba, umuyaga urahuha, byose byikubita kuri iyo nzu ntiyagwa, kuko yari ishinzwe ku rutare.
[26]But everyone who listens to these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a stupid man who built his house on sand.
[26]“Kandi umuntu wese wumva ayo magambo yanjye ntayakomeze, azaba ari nk'umupfapfa wubatse inzu ye ku musenyi,
[27]Rain came down, floods rose, gales blew and struck that house, and it fell; and what a fall it had!'
[27]imvura iragwa, imivu iratemba, umuyaga urahuha, byose byikubita kuri iyo nzu iragwa, kandi kugwa kwayo kwabaye kunini.”
[28]Jesus had now finished what he wanted to say, and his teaching made a deep impression on the people
[28]Yesu amaze kuvuga ayo magambo yose ba bantu batangazwa no kwigisha kwe,
[29]because he taught them with authority, unlike their own scribes.
[29]kuko yabigishaga nk'ufite ubutware, ntase n'abanditsi babo.

Matthew 8:1-34
Mt 8:1-34
[1]After he had come down from the mountain large crowds followed him.
[1]Amanutse kuri uwo musozi, abantu benshi baramukurikira.
[2]Suddenly a man with a virulent skin-disease came up and bowed low in front of him, saying, 'Lord, if you are willing, you can cleanse me.'
[2]Maze haza umubembe aramwegera, aramupfukamira aramubwira ati “Mwami, washaka wabasha kunkiza.”
[3]Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him saying, 'I am willing. Be cleansed.' And his skin-disease was cleansed at once.
[3]Arambura ukuboko amukoraho ati “Ndabishaka kira.”
[4]Then Jesus said to him, 'Mind you tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest and make the offering prescribed by Moses, as evidence to them.'
[4]Uwo mwanya ibibembe bye birakira. Yesu aramubwira ati “Wirinde ntugire uwo ubwira, ahubwo genda wiyereke umutambyi, uture n'ituro Mose yategetse ribabere ikimenyetso cyo kubahamiriza.”
[5]When he went into Capernaum a centurion came up and pleaded with him.
[5]Ageze i Kaperinawumu, haza umutware utwara umutwe w'abasirikare aramwinginga ati
[6]'Sir,' he said, 'my servant is lying at home paralysed and in great pain.'
[6]“Mwami, umugaragu wanjye aryamye mu nzu yararemaye, arababaye cyane.”
[7]Jesus said to him, 'I will come myself and cure him.'
[7]Aramubwira ati “Ndaza mukize.”
[8]The centurion replied, 'Sir, I am not worthy to have you under my roof; just give the word and my servant will be cured.
[8]Umutware w'abasirikare aramusubiza ati “Mwami, ntibinkwiriye yuko winjira mu nzu yanjye, ahubwo tegeka gusa, umugaragu wanjye arakira.
[9]For I am under authority myself and have soldiers under me; and I say to one man, "Go," and he goes; to another, "Come here," and he comes; to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.'
[9]Kuko nanjye ndi umuntu utwarwa n'abandi, mfite abasirikare ntwara. Iyo mbwiye umwe nti ‘Genda’ aragenda, nabwira undi nti ‘Ngwino’ akaza, nabwira umugaragu wanjye nti ‘Kora iki’ akagikora.”
[10]When Jesus heard this he was astonished and said to those following him, 'In truth I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found faith as great as this.
[10]Yesu abyumvise aratangara, abwira abamukurikiye ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko ntabwo nari nabona kwizera kungana gutya, habe no mu Bisirayeli.
[11]And I tell you that many will come from east and west and sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob at the feast in the kingdom of Heaven;
[11]Ndababwira yuko benshi bazaturuka iburasirazuba n'iburengerazuba, bakicarana na Aburahamu na Isaka na Yakobo mu bwami bwo mu ijuru,
[12]but the children of the kingdom will be thrown out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.'
[12]ariko abana bo muri burya bwami bazirukanirwa mu mwijima hanze, ari ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo.”
[13]And to the centurion Jesus said, 'Go back, then; let this be done for you, as your faith demands.' And the servant was cured at that moment.
[13]Yesu abwira uwo mutware ati “Nuko genda bikubere nk'uko wizeye.”Umugaragu we akira uwo mwanya.
[14]And going into Peter's house Jesus found Peter's mother-in-law in bed and feverish.
[14]Yesu ajya mu nzu ya Petero, abona nyirabukwe aryamye arwaye ubuganga,
[15]He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.
[15]amukora ku kuboko ubuganga bumuvamo, arabyuka aramugaburira.
[16]That evening they brought him many who were possessed by devils. He drove out the spirits with a command and cured all who were sick.
[16]Nimugoroba bamuzanira abantu benshi batewe n'abadayimoni, yirukanisha abadayimoni itegeko gusa, akiza abari barwaye bose,
[17]This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: He himself bore our sicknesses away and carried our diseases.
[17]kugira ngo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yesaya bisohore ngo “Ubwe ni we watwaraga ubumuga bwacu, akikorera n'indwara zacu.”
[18]When Jesus saw the crowd all about him he gave orders to leave for the other side.
[18]Kandi Yesu abonye abantu benshi bamugose, ategeka ko bambuka bakajya hakurya.
[19]One of the scribes then came up and said to him, 'Master, I will follow you wherever you go.'
[19]Umwe mu banditsi araza aramubwira ati “Mwigisha, ndagukurikira aho ujya hose.”
[20]Jesus said, 'Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.'
[20]Yesu aramubwira ati “Ingunzu zifite imyobo n'ibiguruka mu kirere bifite ibyari, ariko Umwana w'umuntu ntafite aho kurambika umusaya.”
[21]Another man, one of the disciples, said to him, 'Lord, let me go and bury my father first.'
[21]Undi wo mu bigishwa be aramubwira ati “Databuja, banza undeke ngende mpambe data.”
[22]But Jesus said, 'Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.'
[22]Yesu arambwira ati “Nkurikira, reka abapfuye bihambire abapfuye babo.”
[23]Then he got into the boat followed by his disciples.
[23]Yikira mu bwato, abigishwa be bajyana na we.
[24]Suddenly a storm broke over the lake, so violent that the boat was being swamped by the waves. But he was asleep.
[24]Umuyaga uba mwinshi mu nyanja, ubwato bwabo burengerwa n'umuraba wisuka muri bwo, ariko we yari asinziriye.
[25]So they went to him and woke him saying, 'Save us, Lord, we are lost!'
[25]Baraza baramukangura bati “Databuja, dukize turapfuye.”
[26]And he said to them, 'Why are you so frightened, you who have so little faith?' And then he stood up and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
[26]Arababaza ati “Ni iki kibateye ubwoba, mwa bafite kwizera guke mwe?” Maze arabyuka acyaha umuyaga n'inyanja, biratuza rwose.
[27]They were astounded and said, 'Whatever kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?'
[27]Abantu baratangara bati “Uyu ni muntu ki? Umuyaga n'inyanja na byo biramwumvira!”
[28]When he reached the territory of the Gadarenes on the other side, two demoniacs came towards him out of the tombs -- they were so dangerously violent that nobody could use that path.
[28]Amaze gufata hakurya mu gihugu cy'Abagadareni, ahura n'abantu babiri batewe n'abadayimoni bava mu mva, bari abasazi cyane bituma ari nta watinyuka kunyura muri iyo nzira.
[29]Suddenly they shouted, 'What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before the time?'
[29]Barataka cyane bati “Duhuriye he, Mwana w'Imana? Mbese uje hano kutwica urupfu n'agashinyaguro, igihe cyacu kitaragera?”
[30]Now some distance away there was a large herd of pigs feeding,
[30]Hirya yabo hari umugana w'ingurube nyinshi zirisha.
[31]and the devils pleaded with Jesus, 'If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.'
[31]Abadayimoni bazibonye baramwinginga bati “Nutwirukana utwohereze muri uriya mugana w'ingurube.”
[32]And he said to them, 'Go then,' and they came out and made for the pigs; and at that the whole herd charged down the cliff into the lake and perished in the water.
[32]Arabasubiza ati “Nimugende.” Babavamo baragenda, bajya muri izo ngurube. Umugana wose wirukira ku gacuri, zisuka mu nyanja zipfira mu mazi.
[33]The herdsmen ran off and made for the city, where they told the whole story, including what had happened to the demoniacs.
[33]Abungeri bazo barahunga, binjiye mu mudugudu bavuga ibyo babonye byose, n'iby'abari batewe n'abadayimoni.
[34]Suddenly the whole city set out to meet Jesus; and as soon as they saw him they implored him to leave their neighbourhood.
[34]Abo muri uwo mudugudu bose bajya gusanganira Yesu, bamubonye baramwinginga ngo ave mu gihugu cyabo.

Matthew 9:1-37
Mt 9:1-38
[1]He got back in the boat, crossed the water and came to his home town.
[1]Yikira mu bwato arambuka, agera mu mudugudu w'iwabo.
[2]And suddenly some people brought him a paralytic stretched out on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, 'Take comfort, my child, your sins are forgiven.'
[2]Bamuzanira ikirema kiryamye mu ngobyi, nuko Yesu abonye kwizera kwabo abwira icyo kirema ati “Mwana wanjye, humura ibyaha byawe urabibabariwe.”
[3]And now some scribes said to themselves, 'This man is being blasphemous.'
[3]Abanditsi bamwe baribwira bati “Uyu arigereranije.”
[4]Knowing what was in their minds Jesus said, 'Why do you have such wicked thoughts in your hearts?
[4]Ariko Yesu amenya ibyo bibwira arababaza ati “Ni iki kibateye kwibwira ibidatunganye mu mitima yanyu?
[5]Now, which of these is easier: to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?
[5]Icyoroshye ni ikihe? Ni ukuvuga nti ‘Ibyaha byawe urabibabariwe’, cyangwa nti ‘Byuka ugende’?
[6]But to prove to you that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins,' -- then he said to the paralytic-'get up, pick up your bed and go off home.'
[6]Ariko mumenye yuko Umwana w'umuntu afite ubutware mu isi, bwo kubabarira abantu ibyaha.” Nuko abwira icyo kirema ati “Byuka wikorere ingobyi yawe utahe.”
[7]And the man got up and went home.
[7]Arabyuka aragenda, arataha.
[8]A feeling of awe came over the crowd when they saw this, and they praised God for having given such authority to human beings.
[8]Abantu babibonye baratangara, bahimbaza Imana yahaye abantu ubutware bungana butyo.
[9]As Jesus was walking on from there he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, 'Follow me.' And he got up and followed him.
[9]Yesu avayo, akigenda abona umuntu witwaga Matayo yicaye aho yakoresherezaga ikoro, aramubwira ati “Nkurikira.”Arahaguruka, aramukurikira.
[10]Now while he was at table in the house it happened that a number of tax collectors and sinners came to sit at the table with Jesus and his disciples.
[10]Hanyuma ubwo Yesu yari yicaye mu nzu bafungura, haza abakoresha b'ikoro benshi n'abanyabyaha, basangira na Yesu n'abigishwa be.
[11]When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, 'Why does your master eat with tax collectors and sinners?'
[11]Abafarisayo babibonye babaza abigishwa be bati “Ni iki gitumye umwigisha wanyu asangira n'abakoresha b'ikoro n'abanyabyaha?”
[12]When he heard this he replied, 'It is not the healthy who need the doctor, but the sick.
[12]Abyumvise arababwira ati “Abazima si bo bifuza umuvuzi, keretse abarwayi.
[13]Go and learn the meaning of the words: Mercy is what pleases me, not sacrifice. And indeed I came to call not the upright, but sinners.'
[13]Ariko nimugende, mwige uko iri jambo risobanurwa ngo ‘Icyo nkunda ni imbabazi, si ibitambo.’ Sinazanywe no guhamagara abakiranuka, keretse abanyabyaha.”
[14]Then John's disciples came to him and said, 'Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?'
[14]Maze haza abigishwa ba Yohana baramubaza bati “Ni iki gituma twebwe n'Abafarisayo twiyiriza ubusa kenshi, nyamara abigishwa bawe ntibiyirize ubusa?”
[15]Jesus replied, 'Surely the bridegroom's attendants cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is still with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.
[15]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Abasangwa ntibabasha kugira agahinda bakiri kumwe n'umukwe, ariko iminsi izaza, ubwo umukwe azabavanwamo, ni bwo baziyiriza ubusa.
[16]No one puts a piece of unshrunken cloth onto an old cloak, because the patch pulls away from the cloak and the tear gets worse.
[16]“Nta wutera ikiremo cy'igitambaro gishya ku mwenda ushaje kuko icyo kiremo cyaca umwenda, umwenge ukarushaho kuba mugari.
[17]Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the skins burst, the wine runs out, and the skins are lost. No; they put new wine in fresh skins and both are preserved.'
[17]Kandi nta wusuka vino y'umutobe mu mifuka y'impu ishaje, uwagira atyo iyo mifuka yaturika, vino igasandara hasi imifuka ikononekara. Ahubwo vino y'umutobe isukwa mu mifuka mishya, byombi bikarama.”
[18]While he was speaking to them, suddenly one of the officials came up, who bowed low in front of him and said, 'My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her and her life will be saved.'
[18]Akibabwira ayo magambo, haza umutware aramupfukamira, aramubwira ati “Umukobwa wanjye amaze gupfa, ariko ngwino umurambikeho ikiganza cyawe arahembuka.”
[19]Jesus rose and, with his disciples, followed him.
[19]Yesu arahaguruka, amukurikirana n'abigishwa be.
[20]Then suddenly from behind him came a woman, who had been suffering from a haemorrhage for twelve years, and she touched the fringe of his cloak,
[20]Nuko hari umugore uri mu mugongo wari abimaranye imyaka cumi n'ibiri, amuturuka inyuma akora ku nshunda z'umwenda we,
[21]for she was thinking, 'If only I can touch his cloak I shall be saved.'
[21]kuko yibwiraga ati “Ninkora umwenda we gusa ndakira.”
[22]Jesus turned round and saw her; and he said to her, 'Courage, my daughter, your faith has saved you.' And from that moment the woman was saved.
[22]Yesu arahindukira amubonye aramubwira ati “Mwana wanjye, komera. Kwizera kwawe kuragukijije.” Umugore akira uwo mwanya.
[23]When Jesus reached the official's house and saw the flute-players, with the crowd making a commotion, he said,
[23]Yesu ageze mu muryango w'inzu y'uwo mutware, abona abavuza imyirongi n'abantu benshi baboroga
[24]'Get out of here; the little girl is not dead; she is asleep.' And they ridiculed him.
[24]arababwira ati “Nimuhave kuko agakobwa kadapfuye, ahubwo karasinziriye.” Baramuseka cyane.
[25]But when the people had been turned out he went inside and took her by the hand; and she stood up.
[25]Abantu bamaze guhezwa yinjira mu nzu, agafata ukuboko karabyuka.
[26]And the news of this spread all round the countryside.
[26]Iyo nkuru yamamara muri icyo gihugu cyose.
[27]As Jesus went on his way two blind men followed him shouting, 'Take pity on us, son of David.'
[27]Maze Yesu avayo. akigenda impumyi ebyiri ziramukurikira zitaka ziti “Tubabarire mwene Dawidi.”
[28]And when Jesus reached the house the blind men came up to him and he said to them, 'Do you believe I can do this?' They said, 'Lord, we do.'
[28]Ageze mu nzu izo mpumyi ziramwegera, Yesu arazibaza ati “Mwizeye ko mbishobora?”Ziramusubiza ziti “Yee, Databuja.”
[29]Then he touched their eyes saying, 'According to your faith, let it be done to you.'
[29]Aherako akora ku maso yazo arazibwira ati “Bibabere nk'uko mwizeye.”
[30]And their sight returned. Then Jesus sternly warned them, 'Take care that no one learns about this.'
[30]Amaso yabo arahumuka, Yesu arabihanangiriza cyane ati “Mwirinde ntihagire umuntu ubimenya.”
[31]But when they had gone away, they talked about him all over the countryside.
[31]Nyamara basohotse bamwamamaza hose muri icyo gihugu.
[32]They had only just left when suddenly a man was brought to him, a dumb demoniac.
[32]Bakigenda, bamuzanira ikiragi gitewe na dayimoni.
[33]And when the devil was driven out, the dumb man spoke and the people were amazed and said, 'Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.'
[33]Amaze kwirukana dayimoni ikiragi kiravuga, abantu baratangara bati “Uhereye kera kose ntihigeze kuboneka nk'ibi muri Isirayeli.”
[34]But the Pharisees said, 'It is through the prince of devils that he drives out devils.'
[34]Ariko Abafarisayo baravuga bati “Umutware w'abadayimoni ni we umuha kwirukana abadayimoni.”
[35]Jesus made a tour through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing all kinds of disease and all kinds of illness.
[35]Yesu agenda mu midugudu n'ibirorero byose, yigisha mu masinagogi avuga ubutumwa bwiza bw'ubwami, akiza indwara zose n'ubumuga bwose.
[36]And when he saw the crowds he felt sorry for them because they were harassed and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd.
[36]Abonye abantu uko ari benshi arabababarira, kuko bari barushye cyane basandaye nk'intama zitagira umwungeri.
[37]Then he said to his disciples, 'The harvest is rich but the labourers are few, 
[37]Maze abwira abigishwa be ati “Ibisarurwa ni byinshi, ariko abasaruzi ni bake.
[38]so ask the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers to his harvest.'
[38]Nuko rero mwinginge nyir'ibisarurwa, yohereze abasaruzi mu bisarurwa bye.”

Matthew 10:1-42
Mt 10:1-42
[1]He summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits with power to drive them out and to cure all kinds of disease and all kinds of illness.
[1]Ahamagara abigishwa be cumi na babiri, abaha ubutware bwo kwirukana abadayimoni no gukiza indwara zose n'ubumuga bwose.
[2]These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon who is known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
[2]Amazina y'intumwa cumi n'ebyiri ni aya: uwa mbere ni Simoni witwaga Petero na Andereya mwene se, na Yakobo mwene Zebedayo na Yohana mwene se,
[3]Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
[3]na Filipo na Barutolomayo, na Toma na Matayo umukoresha w'ikoro, na Yakobo mwene Alufayo, na Tadayo
[4]Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who was also his betrayer.
[4]na Simoni Zelote, na Yuda Isikariyota ari we wamugambaniye.
[5]These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them as follows: 'Do not make your way to gentile territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town;
[5]Abo cumi na babiri Yesu arabatuma abategeka ati “Ntimuzajye mu bapagani cyangwa mu midugudu y'Abasamariya,
[6]go instead to the lost sheep of the House of Israel.
[6]ahubwo mujye mu ntama zazimiye z'umuryango wa Isirayeli.
[7]And as you go, proclaim that the kingdom of Heaven is close at hand.
[7]Nimugende mwigisha muti ‘Ubwami bwo mu ijuru buri hafi.’
[8]Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those suffering from virulent skin-diseases, drive out devils. You received without charge, give without charge.
[8]Mukize abarwayi, muzure abapfuye, mukize ababembe, mwirukane abadayimoni. Mwaherewe ubusa, namwe mujye mutangira ubundi.
[9]Provide yourselves with no gold or silver, not even with coppers for your purses,
[9]Ntimujyane izahabu cyangwa ifeza cyangwa amakuta mu mifuka yanyu,
[10]with no haversack for the journey or spare tunic or footwear or a staff, for the labourer deserves his keep.
[10]cyangwa imvumba y'urugendo cyangwa amakanzu abiri, cyangwa inkweto cyangwa inkoni, kuko umukozi akwiriye ibimutunga.
[11]'Whatever town or village you go into, seek out someone worthy and stay with him until you leave.
[11]“Ariko umudugudu wose cyangwa ibirorero, icyo muzajyamo, mushakemo uwo muri cyo ukwiriye, abe ari we ubacumbikira mugeze aho muzacumbukurirayo.
[12]As you enter his house, salute it,
[12]Nimwinjira mu nzu mubaramutse,
[13]and if the house deserves it, may your peace come upon it; if it does not, may your peace come back to you.
[13]inzu niba ikwiriye amahoro yanyu ayizemo, ariko niba idakwiriye amahoro yanyu abagarukire.
[14]And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust from your feet.
[14]Kandi nibanga kubacumbikira cyangwa kumva ibyo muvuga, nimuve muri iyo nzu cyangwa muri uwo mudugudu, mukunkumure umukungugu wo mu birenge byanyu.
[15]In truth I tell you, on the Day of Judgement it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
[15]Ndababwira ukuri yuko ku munsi w'amateka, igihugu cy'i Sodomu n'i Gomora kizahanwa igihano cyakwihanganirwa, kuruta icy'uwo mudugudu.
[16]Look, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; so be cunning as snakes and yet innocent as doves.
[16]“Dore mbatumye muri nk'intama hagati y'amasega, nuko mugire ubwenge nk'inzoka, kandi muzabe nk'inuma mutagira amahugu.
[17]'Be prepared for people to hand you over to sanhedrins and scourge you in their synagogues.
[17]Ariko mwirinde abantu, kuko bazabagambanira mu nkiko, kandi bazabakubitira mu masinagogi,
[18]You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as evidence to them and to the gentiles.
[18]bazabashyīra abatware n'abami babampora, muzaba abo guhamya imbere yabo n'imbere y'abapagani.
[19]But when you are handed over, do not worry about how to speak or what to say; what you are to say will be given to you when the time comes,
[19]Ariko nibabagambanira ntimuzahagarike umutima w'uko muzavuga, cyangwa ibyo muzavuga, kuko muzabibwirwa muri uwo mwanya.
[20]because it is not you who will be speaking; the Spirit of your Father will be speaking in you.
[20]Kuko atari mwe muzaba muvuga, ahubwo ari Umwuka wa So uzabavugisha.
[21]'Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will come forward against their parents and have them put to death.
[21]“Umuvandimwe azagambanira mwene se ngo yicwe, na se w'umwana azamugambanira, n'abana bazagomera ababyeyi ngo babīcīshe.
[22]You will be universally hated on account of my name; but anyone who stands firm to the end will be saved.
[22]Muzangwa n'abantu bose babahora izina ryanjye, ariko uwihangana akageza imperuka ni we uzakizwa.
[23]If they persecute you in one town, take refuge in the next; and if they persecute you in that, take refuge in another. In truth I tell you, you will not have gone the round of the towns of Israel before the Son of man comes.
[23]Nibabarenganiriza mu mudugudu umwe muzahungire mu wundi. Ndababwira ukuri, yuko mutazarangiza imidugudu yose ya Isirayeli, Umwana w'umuntu ataraza.
[24]'Disciple is not superior to teacher, nor slave to master.
[24]“Umwigishwa ntaruta umwigisha, kandi n'umugaragu ntaruta shebuja.
[25]It is enough for disciple to grow to be like teacher, and slave like master. If they have called the master of the house "Beelzebul", how much more the members of his household?
[25]Birahagije ko umwigishwa amera nk'umwigisha, n'umugaragu akamera nka shebuja. Niba bise nyir'urugo Belizebuli, nkanswe abari mu rugo rwe!
[26]'So do not be afraid of them. Everything now covered up will be uncovered, and everything now hidden will be made clear.
[26]“Nuko ntimuzabatinye kuko ari nta cyatwikiriwe kitazatwikururwa, cyangwa igihishwe kitazamenyekana.
[27]What I say to you in the dark, tell in the daylight; what you hear in whispers, proclaim from the housetops.
[27]Ibyo mbabwirira mu mwijima muzabivugire ku mugaragaro, n'ibyo mwongorewe muzabirangururire hejuru y'amazu.
[28]'Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; fear him rather who can destroy both body and soul in hell.
[28]Kandi ntimuzatinye abica umubiri badashobora kwica ubugingo, ahubwo mutinye ushobora kurimburira ubugingo n'umubiri muri Gehinomu.
[29]Can you not buy two sparrows for a penny? And yet not one falls to the ground without your Father knowing.
[29]Mbese ibishwi bibiri ntibabigura ikuta rimwe? Ariko nta na kimwe kigwa hasi ngo gipfe, So atabizi,
[30]Why, every hair on your head has been counted.
[30]ndetse n'imisatsi yo ku mitwe yanyu irabazwe yose.
[31]So there is no need to be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
[31]Nuko ntimutinye, kuko muruta ibishwi byinshi.
[32]'So if anyone declares himself for me in the presence of human beings, I will declare myself for him in the presence of my Father in heaven.
[32]“Umuntu wese uzampamiriza imbere y'abantu, nanjye nzamuhamiriza imbere ya Data uri mu ijuru.
[33]But the one who disowns me in the presence of human beings, I will disown in the presence of my Father in heaven.
[33]Ariko uzanyihakanira imbere y'abantu wese, nanjye nzamwihakanira imbere ya Data uri mu ijuru.
[34]'Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth: it is not peace I have come to bring, but a sword.
[34]“Mwe gutekereza ko nazanywe no kuzana amahoro mu isi. Sinaje kuzana amahoro, ahubwo naje kuzana inkota.
[35]For I have come to set son against father, daughter against mother, daughter-in-law against mother-in-law;
[35]Kuko naje gutanya umwana na se, umukobwa na nyina, umukazana na nyirabukwe,
[36]a person's enemies will be the members of his own household.
[36]abanzi b'umuntu bazaba abo mu rugo rwe.
[37]'No one who prefers father or mother to me is worthy of me. No one who prefers son or daughter to me is worthy of me.
[37]“Ukunda se cyangwa nyina kubandutisha ntaba akwiriye kuba uwanjye, kandi ukunda umuhungu we cyangwa umukobwa we kubandutisha, ntaba akwiriye kuba uwanjye.
[38]Anyone who does not take his cross and follow in my footsteps is not worthy of me.
[38]Kandi utikorera umusaraba we ngo ankurikire, ntakwiriye kuba uwanjye.
[39]Anyone who finds his life will lose it; anyone who loses his life for my sake will find it.
[39]Urengera ubugingo bwe azabubura, ariko utita ku bugingo bwe ku bwanjye, azabubona.
[40]'Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me; and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
[40]“Ubemera ni jye aba yemeye, kandi unyemera aba yemeye Iyantumye.
[41]'Anyone who welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will have a prophet's reward; and anyone who welcomes an upright person because he is upright will have the reward of an upright person.
[41]Uwemera umuhanuzi kuko ari umuhanuzi azahabwa ingororano y'umuhanuzi, kandi uwemera umukiranutsi kuko ari umukiranutsi azahabwa ingororano y'umukiranutsi.
[42]'If anyone gives so much as a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is a disciple, then in truth I tell you, he will most certainly not go without his reward.'
[42]Kandi uzanywesha umwe muri aba bato ku gacuma k'amazi akonje gusa, kuko ari umwigishwa wanjye, ndababwira ukuri yuko atazabura ingororano ye.”

Matthew 11:1-30
Mt 11:1-30
[1]When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he moved on from there to teach and preach in their towns.
[1]Yesu amaze gutegeka abigishwa be cumi na babiri, avayo ajya kwigisha no kubwiriza abantu mu midugudu y'aho.
[2]Now John had heard in prison what Christ was doing and he sent his disciples to ask him,
[2]Ariko Yohana yumviye mu nzu y'imbohe ibyo Yesu akora, atuma abigishwa be ko bamubaza bati
[3]'Are you the one who is to come, or are we to expect someone else?'
[3]“Mbese ni wowe wa wundi ukwiriye kuza, cyangwa dutegereze undi?”
[4]Jesus answered, 'Go back and tell John what you hear and see;
[4]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Nimugende mubwire Yohana ibyo mwumvise n'ibyo mubonye.
[5]the blind see again, and the lame walk, those suffering from virulent skin-diseases are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life and the good news is proclaimed to the poor;
[5]Impumyi zirahumuka, ibirema biragenda, ababembe barakira, ibipfamatwi birumva, abapfuye barazurwa, abakene barabwirwa ubutumwa bwiza.
[6]and blessed is anyone who does not find me a cause of falling.'
[6]Kandi hahirwa uwo ibyanjye bitazagusha.”
[7]As the men were leaving, Jesus began to talk to the people about John, 'What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swaying in the breeze? No?
[7]Abo bakigenda, Yesu atangira kuvugana n'abantu ibya Yohana ati “Mwagiye mu butayu kureba iki? Urubingo ruhungabanywa n'umuyaga?
[8]Then what did you go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothes are to be found in palaces.
[8]Ariko mwagiye kureba iki? Umuntu wambaye imyenda yorohereye? Erega abambara iyorohereye baba mu ngo z'abami!
[9]Then what did you go out for? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet:
[9]Ariko mwajyanywe n'iki? Kureba umuhanuzi? Ni koko, kandi ndababwira yuko aruta umuhanuzi cyane.
[10]he is the one of whom scripture says: Look, I am going to send my messenger in front of you to prepare your way before you.
[10]Uwo ni we wandikiwe ngo‘Dore ndenda gutuma integuza yanjye mbere yawe,Izakubanziriza igutunganirize inzira.’
[11]'In truth I tell you, of all the children born to women, there has never been anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.
[11]“Ndababwira ukuri, yuko mu babyawe n'abagore hatigeze kubaho umuntu uruta Yohana Umubatiza, ariko umuto mu bwami bwo mu ijuru aramuruta.
[12]Since John the Baptist came, up to this present time, the kingdom of Heaven has been subjected to violence and the violent are taking it by storm.
[12]Uhereye ku gihe cya Yohana Umubatiza ukageza none, ubwami bwo mu ijuru buratwaranirwa, intwarane zibugishamo imbaraga.
[13]Because it was towards John that all the prophecies of the prophets and of the Law were leading;
[13]Kuko abahanuzi bose n'amategeko byahanuye kugeza igihe cya Yohana,
[14]and he, if you will believe me, is the Elijah who was to return.
[14]kandi niba mushaka kubyemera, ni we Eliya wahanuwe ko azaza.
[15]Anyone who has ears should listen!
[15]Ufite amatwi yumva niyumve.
[16]'What comparison can I find for this generation? It is like children shouting to each other as they sit in the market place:
[16]“Ariko ab'iki gihe ndabagereranya n'iki? Bameze nk'abana bato bicaye mu maguriro bahamagara bagenzi babo bati
[17]We played the pipes for you, and you wouldn't dance; we sang dirges, and you wouldn't be mourners.
[17]‘Twabavugirije imyironge ntimwabyina, twaboroze ntimwarira.’
[18]'For John came, neither eating nor drinking, and they say, "He is possessed."
[18]Kuko Yohana yaje atarya atanywa, bagira bati ‘Afite dayimoni.’
[19]The Son of man came, eating and drinking, and they say, "Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners." Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.'
[19]Umwana w'umuntu aje arya anywa, bagira bati ‘Dore iki kirura cy'umunywi w'inzoga, incuti y'abakoresha b'ikoro n'abanyabyaha.’ Ariko ubwenge bwerekanwa n'imirimo yabwo.”
[20]Then he began to reproach the towns in which most of his miracles had been worked, because they refused to repent.
[20]Maze atangiriraho gucyaha imidugudu, iyo yakoreyemo ibitangaza byinshi, kuko batihannye.
[21]'Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
[21]Ati “Korazini, uzabona ishyano! Betsayida, uzabona ishyano! Kuko ibitangaza byakorewe muri mwe, iyaba byarakorewe muri Tiro n'i Sidoni baba barihannye kera, bakambara ibigunira, bakisīga ivu.
[22]Still, I tell you that it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on Judgement Day than for you.
[22]Ariko ndababwira yuko ku munsi w'amateka, i Tiro n'i Sidoni hazahanwa igihano cyakwihanganirwa kuruta icyanyu.
[23]And as for you, Capernaum, did you want to be raised as high as heaven? You shall be flung down to hell. For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been standing yet.
[23]Nawe Kaperinawumu, ushyizwe hejuru ndetse ugeze ku ijuru. Ariko uzamanuka ikuzimu, kuko ibitangaza byakorewe muri wowe iyaba byarakorewe muri Sodomu, iba ikiriho na none.
[24]Still, I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on Judgement Day than for you.'
[24]Ariko ndababwira yuko ku munsi w'amateka, igihugu cy'i Sodomu kizahanwa igihano cyakwihanganirwa kuruta icyanyu.”
[25]At that time Jesus exclaimed, 'I bless you, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, for hiding these things from the learned and the clever and revealing them to little children.
[25]Muri iyo minsi Yesu aravuga ati “Ndagushima Data, Mwami w'ijuru n'isi, kuko wahishe ibyo abanyabwenge n'abahanga, ukabimenyesha abana bato.
[26]Yes, Father, for that is what it pleased you to do.
[26]Ni koko Data, kuko ari ko wabishatse.
[27]Everything has been entrusted to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, just as no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
[27]“Byose nabihawe na Data, kandi nta wuzi Umwana w'Imana keretse Se, kandi nta wuzi Se keretse Umwana w'Imana, n'umuntu wese uwo Mwana ashatse kuyimenyesha.
[28]'Come to me, all you who labour and are overburdened, and I will give you rest.
[28]“Mwese abarushye n'abaremerewe, nimuze munsange ndabaruhura.
[29]Shoulder my yoke and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
[29]Mwemere kuba abagaragu banjye munyigireho, kuko ndi umugwaneza kandi noroheje mu mutima, namwe muzabona uburuhukiro mu mitima yanyu,
[30]Yes, my yoke is easy and my burden light.'
[30]kuko kunkorera kutaruhije, n'umutwaro wanjye utaremereye.”

Matthew 12:1-50
Mt 12:1-50
[1]At that time Jesus went through the cornfields one Sabbath day. His disciples were hungry and began to pick ears of corn and eat them.
[1]Nuko icyo gihe Yesu agenda anyura mu mirima y'amasaka ku isabato, abigishwa be barasonza, batangira guca amahundo barayahekenya.
[2]The Pharisees noticed it and said to him, 'Look, your disciples are doing something that is forbidden on the Sabbath.'
[2]Maze Abafarisayo bababonye baramubwira bati “Dore abigishwa bawe ko bakora ibizira ku isabato!”
[3]But he said to them, 'Have you not read what David did when he and his followers were hungry-
[3]Na we arababaza ati “Mbese ntimwasomye icyo Dawidi yakoze ubwo yasonzanaga n'abo bari bari kumwe,
[4]how he went into the house of God and they ate the loaves of the offering although neither he nor his followers were permitted to eat them, but only the priests?
[4]ko yinjiye mu nzu y'Imana akarya imitsima yo kumurikwa, amategeko atemeye ko ayirya cyangwa abo bari bari kumwe, keretse abatambyi bonyine?
[5]Or again, have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath day the Temple priests break the Sabbath without committing any fault?
[5]Cyangwa ntimwasomye mu mategeko, uko abatambyi bazirura isabato bari mu rusengero, nyamara ntibabeho umugayo?
[6]Now here, I tell you, is something greater than the Temple.
[6]Ariko ndababwira yuko uruta urusengero ari hano.
[7]And if you had understood the meaning of the words: Mercy is what pleases me, not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the blameless.
[7]Iyaba mwari muzi uko iri jambo risobanurwa ngo ‘Nkunda imbabazi kuruta ibitambo’ ntimwagaya abatariho urubanza,
[8]For the Son of man is master of the Sabbath.'
[8]kuko Umwana w'umuntu ari Umwami w'isabato.”
[9]He moved on from there and went to their synagogue;
[9]Avayo ajya mu isinagogi yabo,
[10]now a man was there with a withered hand. They asked him, 'Is it permitted to cure somebody on the Sabbath day?' hoping for something to charge him with.
[10]asangamo umuntu unyunyutse ukuboko. Babaza Yesu bati “Mbese amategeko yemera gukiza umuntu ku isabato?” Ni ko bamubajije ngo babone uko bamurega.
[11]But he said to them, 'If any one of you here had only one sheep and it fell down a hole on the Sabbath day, would he not get hold of it and lift it out?
[11]Arabasubiza ati “Ni nde muri mwe waba afite intama imwe, ikagwa mu mwobo ku isabato ntayikuremo?
[12]Now a man is far more important than a sheep, so it follows that it is permitted on the Sabbath day to do good.'
[12]Mbese umuntu ntaruta intama cyane? Nuko rero amategeko ntabuzanya gukora neza ku isabato.”
[13]Then he said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.' He stretched it out and his hand was restored, as sound as the other one.
[13]Maze abwira uwo muntu ati “Rambura ukuboko kwawe.”Arakurambura, kurakira kuba nk'ukundi.
[14]At this the Pharisees went out and began to plot against him, discussing how to destroy him.
[14]Abafarisayo barasohoka bajya inama, ngo babone uko bazamwica.
[15]Jesus knew this and withdrew from the district. Many followed him and he cured them all
[15]Yesu abimenye arahava, abantu benshi bajyana na we abakiza bose,
[16]but warned them not to make him known.
[16]arabahana ngo batamwamamaza
[17]This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
[17]ngo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yesaya bisohore ngo
[18]Look! My servant whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul delights, I will send my Spirit upon him, and he will present judgement to the nations;
[18]“Dore umugaragu wanjye nkunda natoranyije,Umutima wanjye ukamwishimira.Nzamushyiramo Umwuka wanjye,Azamenyesha abanyamahanga ibyo gukiranuka.
[19]he will not brawl or cry out, his voice is not heard in the streets,
[19]Ntazatongana, ntazasakuza,Ndetse no mu nzira nta wuzumva ijwi rye.
[20]he will not break the crushed reed, or snuff the faltering wick,
[20]Urubingo rusadutse ntazaruvuna,Kandi n'urumuri rucumba ntazaruzimya,Kugeza ubwo azaneshesha gukiranuka kwe,
[21]until he has made judgement victorious; in him the nations will put their hope.
[21]kandi izina rye abanyamahanga bazaryizigira.”
[22]Then they brought to him a blind and dumb demoniac; and he cured him, so that the dumb man could speak and see.
[22]Maze bamuzanira impumyi yari ikiragi itewe na dayimoni, arayikiza. Uwari ikiragi avuga ubwo kandi arahumuka.
[23]All the people were astounded and said, 'Can this be the son of David?'
[23]Abantu bose baratangara baravuga bati “Mbese aho uyu si we mwene Dawidi?”
[24]But when the Pharisees heard this they said, 'The man drives out devils only through Beelzebul, the chief of the devils.'
[24]Ariko Abafarisayo babyumvise baravuga bati “Uyu nta wundi umuha kwirukana abadayimoni, keretse Belizebuli umutware w'abadayimoni.”
[25]Knowing what was in their minds he said to them, 'Every kingdom divided against itself is heading for ruin; and no town, no household divided against itself can last.
[25]Amenye ibyo bibwira arababwira ati “Ubwami bwose iyo bwigabanyije ubwabwo burarimbuka, n'umudugudu wose cyangwa inzu yose, iyo byigabanyije ubwabyo ntibigumaho.
[26]Now if Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself; so how can his kingdom last?
[26]None se Satani niba yirukana Satani ko aba yigabanyije ubwe, ubwami bwe buzagumaho bute?
[27]And if it is through Beelzebul that I drive devils out, through whom do your own experts drive them out? They shall be your judges, then.
[27]Nanjye niba ari Belizebuli umpa kwirukana abadayimoni, abana banyu ni nde ubaha kubirukana? Ni cyo gituma ari bo babacira urubanza.
[28]But if it is through the Spirit of God that I drive out devils, then be sure that the kingdom of God has caught you unawares.
[28]Ariko Umwuka w'Imana niba ari we umpa kwirukana abadayimoni, noneho ubwami bw'Imana buba bubaguye gitumo.
[29]'Or again, how can anyone make his way into a strong man's house and plunder his property unless he has first tied up the strong man? Only then can he plunder his house.
[29]“Umuntu yabasha ate kwinjira mu nzu y'umunyamaboko ngo amusahure ibintu, atabanje kuboha uwo munyamaboko, ko ari bwo yabona uko asahura inzu ye?
[30]'Anyone who is not with me is against me, and anyone who does not gather in with me throws away.
[30]“Uwo tutabana ni umwanzi wanjye, kandi uwo tudateranyiriza hamwe arasandaza.
[31]And so I tell you, every human sin and blasphemy will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
[31]Ni cyo gitumye mbabwira yuko abantu bazababarirwa icyaha cyose n'igitutsi, ariko gutuka Umwuka ni icyaha kitazababarirwa.
[32]And anyone who says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but no one who speaks against the Holy Spirit will be forgiven either in this world or in the next.
[32]Kandi umuntu wese usebya Umwana w'umuntu azababarirwa, ariko usebya Umwuka Wera ntazababarirwa, naho haba mu gihe cya none cyangwa mu gihe kizaza.
[33]'Make a tree sound and its fruit will be sound; make a tree rotten and its fruit will be rotten. For the tree can be told by its fruit.
[33]“Nimwite igiti cyiza n'imbuto zacyo muzite nziza, cyangwa nimwite igiti kibi n'imbuto zacyo muzite mbi, kuko igiti kimenyekanishwa n'imbuto zacyo.
[34]You brood of vipers, how can your speech be good when you are evil? For words flow out of what fills the heart.
[34]Mwa bana b'incira mwe, mwabasha mute kuvuga amagambo meza muri babi? Ibyuzuye mu mutima ni byo akanwa kavuga.
[35]Good people draw good things from their store of goodness; bad people draw bad things from their store of badness.
[35]Umuntu mwiza atanga ibyiza abikuye mu butunzi bwe bwiza, n'umuntu mubi atanga ibibi abikuye mu butunzi bwe bubi.
[36]So I tell you this, that for every unfounded word people utter they will answer on Judgement Day,
[36]“Kandi ndababwira yuko ijambo ry'impfabusa ryose abantu bavuga, bazaribazwa ku munsi w'amateka.
[37]since it is by your words you will be justified, and by your words condemned.'
[37]Amagambo yawe ni yo azagutsindishiriza, kandi n'amagambo yawe ni yo azagutsindisha.”
[38]Then some of the scribes and Pharisees spoke up. 'Master,' they said, 'we should like to see a sign from you.'
[38]Nuko bamwe mu banditsi n'Abafarisayo baramusubiza bati “Mwigisha, turashaka kureba ikimenyetso kiguturukaho.”
[39]He replied, 'It is an evil and unfaithful generation that asks for a sign! The only sign it will be given is the sign of the prophet Jonah.
[39]Na we arabasubiza ati “Abantu b'igihe kibi bishimira ubusambanyi, bashaka ikimenyetso ariko nta kimenyetso bazahabwa, keretse icy'umuhanuzi Yona.
[40]For as Jonah remained in the belly of the sea-monster for three days and three nights, so will the Son of man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
[40]Nk'uko Yona yamaze iminsi itatu n'amajoro atatu mu nda y'urufi, ni ko n'Umwana w'umuntu azamara iminsi itatu n'amajoro atatu ikuzimu.
[41]On Judgement Day the men of Nineveh will appear against this generation and they will be its condemnation, because when Jonah preached they repented; and look, there is something greater than Jonah here.
[41]Ab'i Nineve bazahagurukana n'ab'iki gihe ku munsi w'amateka, babatsindishe kuko bihannye ubwo bumvaga kwigisha kwa Yona, kandi dore uruta Yona ari hano.
[42]On Judgement Day the Queen of the South will appear against this generation and be its condemnation, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and look, there is something greater than Solomon here.
[42]Umugabekazi w'igihugu cy'i kusi azahagurukana n'ab'iki gihe ku munsi w'amateka abatsindishe, kuko yavanywe ku mpera y'isi no kumva ubwenge bwa Salomo, kandi dore uruta Salomo ari hano.
[43]'When an unclean spirit goes out of someone it wanders through waterless country looking for a place to rest, and cannot find one.
[43]“Dayimoni iyo avuye mu muntu, anyura ahadafite amazi ashaka uburuhukiro akabubura.
[44]Then it says, "I will return to the home I came from." But on arrival, finding it unoccupied, swept and tidied,
[44]Akavuga ati ‘Reka nsubire mu nzu yanjye navuyemo.’ Yagerayo agasanga irimo ubusa, ikubuwe, iteguwe.
[45]it then goes off and collects seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and set up house there, and so that person ends up worse off than before. That is what will happen to this wicked generation.'
[45]Ni ko kugenda akazana abandi badayimoni barindwi bamurusha kuba babi, bakinjira bakabamo, ibyo hanyuma by'uwo muntu bikarusha ibya mbere kuba bibi. Ni ko bizaba ku b'iki gihe kibi.”
[46]He was still speaking to the crowds when suddenly his mother and his brothers were standing outside and were anxious to have a word with him.
[46]Akivugana n'abantu, nyina na bene se bari bahagaze hanze, bashaka kuvugana na we.
[47]still speaking to the crowds when suddenly his mother and his brothers were standing outside and were anxious to have a word with him.
[47]Umuntu aramubwira ati “Nyoko na bene so bahagaze hanze barashaka ko muvugana.”
[48]But to the man who told him this Jesus replied, 'Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?'
[48]Na we asubiza ubimubwiye, aramubaza ati “Mama ni nde, na bene data ni bande?”
[49]And stretching out his hand towards his disciples he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers.
[49]Arambura ukuboko agutunga abigishwa be ati “Dore mama na bene data.
[50]Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.'
[50]Umuntu wese ukora ibyo Data wo mu ijuru ashaka, ni we mwene data, ni we mushiki wanjye, ni we mama.”

Matthew 13:1-58
Mt 13:1-58
[1]That same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeside,
[1]Uwo munsi Yesu asohoka mu nzu, yicara mu kibaya cy'inyanja.
[2]but such large crowds gathered round him that he got into a boat and sat there. The people all stood on the shore,
[2]Abantu benshi bateranira aho ari, bituma yikira mu bwato yicaramo, abantu bose bahagarara mu kibaya.
[3]and he told them many things in parables. He said, 'Listen, a sower went out to sow.
[3]Abigisha byinshi, abacira imigani aravuga ati“Umubibyi yasohoye imbuto.
[4]As he sowed, some seeds fell on the edge of the path, and the birds came and ate them up.
[4]Akibiba zimwe zigwa mu nzira, inyoni ziraza zirazitoragura.
[5]Others fell on patches of rock where they found little soil and sprang up at once, because there was no depth of earth;
[5]Izindi zigwa ku kāra kadafite ubutaka bwinshi, uwo mwanya ziramera kuko ubutaka atari burebure,
[6]but as soon as the sun came up they were scorched and, not having any roots, they withered away.
[6]izuba rivuye ziraraba, maze kuko zitari zifite imizi ziruma.
[7]Others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
[7]Izindi zigwa mu mahwa, amahwa arāruka araziniga.
[8]Others fell on rich soil and produced their crop, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
[8]Izindi zigwa mu butaka bwiza zera imbuto, imwe ijana, indi mirongo itandatu, indi mirongo itatu, bityo bityo.
[9]Anyone who has ears should listen!'
[9]Ufite amatwi niyumve.”
[10]Then the disciples went up to him and asked, 'Why do you talk to them in parables?'
[10]Abigishwa baramwegera baramubaza bati “Ni iki gituma ubigishiriza mu migani?”
[11]In answer, he said, 'Because to you is granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not granted.
[11]Arabasubiza ati “Mwebweho mwahawe kumenya ubwiru bw'ubwami bwo mu ijuru ariko bo ntibabihawe,
[12]Anyone who has will be given more and will have more than enough; but anyone who has not will be deprived even of what he has.
[12]kuko ufite wese azahabwa kandi akarushirizwaho, ariko udafite wese azakwa n'icyo yari afite.
[13]The reason I talk to them in parables is that they look without seeing and listen without hearing or understanding.
[13]Igituma mbigishiriza mu migani ni iki: ‘Ni uko iyo barebye batitegereza, n'iyo bumvise batumva kandi ntibasobanukirwe.’
[14]So in their case what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah is being fulfilled: Listen and listen, but never understand! Look and look, but never perceive!
[14]Ndetse ibyo Yesaya yahanuye bibasohoyeho ngo‘Kumva muzumva, ariko ntimuzabisobanukirwa,Kureba muzareba, ariko ntimuzabibona.
[15]This people's heart has grown coarse, their ears dulled, they have shut their eyes tight to avoid using their eyes to see, their ears to hear, their heart to understand, changing their ways and being healed by me.
[15]Kuko umutima w'ubu bwoko ufite ibinure,Amatwi yabo akaba ari ibihurihuri,Amaso yabo bakayahumiriza,Ngo batarebesha amaso,Batumvisha amatwi,Batamenyesha umutima,Bagahindukira ngo mbakize.’
[16]'But blessed are your eyes because they see, your ears because they hear!
[16]“Ariko amaso yanyu arahirwa kuko abona, n'amatwi yanyu kuko yumva.
[17]In truth I tell you, many prophets and upright people longed to see what you see, and never saw it; to hear what you hear, and never heard it.
[17]Ndababwira ukuri, yuko abahanuzi benshi n'abakiranutsi bifuzaga kureba ibyo mureba ntibabibone, no kumva ibyo mwumva ntibabyumve.
[18]'So pay attention to the parable of the sower.
[18]“Nuko nimwumve umugani w'umubibyi.
[19]When anyone hears the word of the kingdom without understanding, the Evil One comes and carries off what was sown in his heart: this is the seed sown on the edge of the path.
[19]Uwumva wese ijambo ry'ubwami ntarimenye, Umubi araza agasahura ikibibwe mu mutima we. Uwo ni we usa n'izibibwe mu nzira.
[20]The seed sown on patches of rock is someone who hears the word and welcomes it at once with joy.
[20]Kandi usa n'izibibwe ku kāra, uwo ni we wumva ijambo, uwo mwanya akaryemera anezerewe,
[21]But such a person has no root deep down and does not last; should some trial come, or some persecution on account of the word, at once he falls away.
[21]ntagire imizi muri we, maze agakomera umwanya muto. Iyo habayeho amakuba cyangwa kurenganywa azira iryo jambo, uwo mwanya biramugusha.
[22]The seed sown in thorns is someone who hears the word, but the worry of the world and the lure of riches choke the word and so it produces nothing.
[22]Kandi usa n'izibibwe mu mahwa, uwo ni we wumva ijambo, maze amaganya y'iyi si n'ibihendo by'ubutunzi bikaniga iryo jambo ntiryere.
[23]And the seed sown in rich soil is someone who hears the word and understands it; this is the one who yields a harvest and produces now a hundredfold, now sixty, now thirty.'
[23]Kandi usa n'izibibwe mu butaka bwiza, uwo ni we wumva ijambo akarimenya, akera imbuto umwe ijana, undi mirongo itandatu, undi mirongo itatu.”
[24]He put another parable before them, 'The kingdom of Heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.
[24]Nuko abacira undi mugani aravuga ati “Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'umuntu wabibye imbuto nziza mu murima we,
[25]While everybody was asleep his enemy came, sowed darnel all among the wheat, and made off.
[25]nuko abantu basinziriye, umwanzi araza abiba urukungu mu masaka, aragenda.
[26]When the new wheat sprouted and ripened, then the darnel appeared as well.
[26]Nuko amaze kumera no kwera, urukungu na rwo ruraboneka.
[27]The owner's labourers went to him and said, "Sir, was it not good seed that you sowed in your field? If so, where does the darnel come from?"
[27]Abagaragu be baraza babaza umutware bati ‘Mutware, ntiwabibye imbuto nziza mu murima wawe? None urukungu rurimo rwavuye he?’
[28]He said to them, "Some enemy has done this." And the labourers said, "Do you want us to go and weed it out?"
[28]Ati ‘Umwanzi ni we wagize atyo.’ Abagaragu be baramubaza bati ‘Noneho urashaka ko tugenda tukarurandura?’
[29]But he said, "No, because when you weed out the darnel you might pull up the wheat with it.
[29]Na we ati ‘Oya, ahari nimurandura urukungu murarurandurana n'amasaka,
[30]Let them both grow till the harvest; and at harvest time I shall say to the reapers: First collect the darnel and tie it in bundles to be burnt, then gather the wheat into my barn." '
[30]mureke bikurane byombi bigeze igihe cyo gusarurwa. Mu isarura nzabwira abasaruzi nti: Mubanze muteranye urukungu muruhambire imitwaro rutwikwe, maze amasaka muyahunike mu kigega cyanjye.’ ”
[31]He put another parable before them, 'The kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field.
[31]Abacira undi mugani ati “Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'akabuto ka sinapi, umuntu yenze akakabiba mu murima we.
[32]It is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the biggest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air can come and shelter in its branches.'
[32]Na ko ni gato hanyuma y'imbuto zose, nyamara iyo gakuze kaba kanini kakaruta imboga zose kakaba igiti, maze inyoni zo mu kirere zikaza zikarika ibyari mu mashami yacyo.”
[33]He told them another parable, 'The kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour till it was leavened all through.'
[33]Abacira undi mugani ati “Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'umusemburo umugore yenze, akawuhisha mu myariko itatu y'ifu kugeza aho iri busemburwe yose.”
[34]In all this Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; indeed, he would never speak to them except in parables.
[34]Ayo magambo yose Yesu ayigisha abantu mu migani, kandi nta cyo yabigishaga atabaciriye umugani,
[35]This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet: I will speak to you in parables, unfold what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.
[35]kugira ngo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi bisohore ngo“Nzabumbura akanwa kanjye nce imigani,Nzavuga amagambo yahishwe uhereye ku kuremwa kw'isi.”
[36]Then, leaving the crowds, he went to the house; and his disciples came to him and said, 'Explain to us the parable about the darnel in the field.'
[36]Maze asezera ku bantu yinjira mu nzu, abigishwa be baramwegera bati “Dusobanurire umugani w'urukungu rwo mu murima.”
[37]He said in reply, 'The sower of the good seed is the Son of man.
[37]Arabasubiza ati “Ubiba imbuto nziza ni Umwana w'umuntu,
[38]The field is the world; the good seed is the subjects of the kingdom; the darnel, the subjects of the Evil One;
[38]umurima ni isi, imbuto nziza ni zo bana b'ubwami, urukungu ni abana b'Umubi,
[39]the enemy who sowed it, the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; the reapers are the angels.
[39]umwanzi warubibye ni Umwanzi, isarura ni imperuka y'isi, abasaruzi ni abamarayika.
[40]Well then, just as the darnel is gathered up and burnt in the fire, so it will be at the end of time.
[40]Nk'uko urukungu rurandurwa rugatwikwa, ni ko bizaba ku mperuka y'isi.
[41]The Son of man will send his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of falling and all who do evil,
[41]Umwana w'umuntu azatuma abamarayika be, bateranye ibintu bigusha byose n'inkozi z'ibibi babikure mu bwami bwe,
[42]and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
[42]babajugunye mu itanura ry'umuriro. Ni ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo.
[43]Then the upright will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Anyone who has ears should listen!
[43]Icyo gihe abakiranutsi bazarabagirana nk'izuba mu bwami bwa Se. Ufite amatwi niyumve.
[44]'The kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone has found; he hides it again, goes off in his joy, sells everything he owns and buys the field.
[44]“Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'izahabu zahishwe mu murima, umuntu azigwaho arazitwikīra aragenda, umunezero umutera kugura ibyo yari atunze byose ngo abone kugura uwo murima.
[45]'Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls;
[45]“Kandi ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'umutunzi ushaka imaragarita nziza,
[46]when he finds one of great value he goes and sells everything he owns and buys it.
[46]abonye imaragarita imwe y'igiciro cyinshi, aragenda agura ibyo yari atunze byose ngo abone kuyigura.
[47]'Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that is cast in the sea and brings in a haul of all kinds of fish.
[47]“Nuko kandi ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'urushundura bajugunya mu nyanja, ruroba ifi z'amoko yose.
[48]When it is full, the fishermen bring it ashore; then, sitting down, they collect the good ones in baskets and throw away those that are no use.
[48]Iyo rwuzuye barukururira ku nkombe, bakicara bagatoranyamo inziza bakazishyira mu mbehe, imbi bakazita.
[49]This is how it will be at the end of time: the angels will appear and separate the wicked from the upright,
[49]Uko ni ko bizaba ku mperuka y'isi: abamarayika bazasohoka batoranye abanyabyaha mu bakiranutsi,
[50]to throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.
[50]babajugunye mu itanura ry'umuriro, ni ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo.
[51]'Have you understood all these?' They said, 'Yes.'
[51]“Ayo magambo yose aho murayumvise?”Baramusubiza bati “Yee.”
[52]And he said to them, 'Well then, every scribe who becomes a disciple of the kingdom of Heaven is like a householder who brings out from his storeroom new things as well as old.'
[52]Arababwira ati “Ni cyo gitumye umwanditsi wese wigishijwe iby'ubwami bwo mu ijuru agereranywa na nyir'urugo utanga ibintu bishya n'ibya kera, abikuye mu bubiko bwe.”
[53]When Jesus had finished these parables he left the district;
[53]Yesu amaze kubacira iyo migani, avayo
[54]and, coming to his home town, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a way that they were astonished and said, 'Where did the man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?
[54]ajya mu gihugu cy'iwabo, aheraho yigishiriza mu masinagogi yabo, bituma batangara bati “Ubu bwenge n'ibi bitangaza uyu yabikuye he?
[55]This is the carpenter's son, surely? Is not his mother the woman called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Jude?
[55]Mbese harya si we wa mwana w'umubaji? Nyina ntiyitwa Mariya, na bene se si Yakobo na Yosefu na Simoni na Yuda?
[56]His sisters, too, are they not all here with us? So where did the man get it all?'
[56]Bashiki be na bo bose ntiduturanye? Mbese ibyo byose yabikuye he?”
[57]And they would not accept him. But Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is despised only in his own country and in his own house,'
[57]Ibye birabagusha.Yesu arababwira ati “Umuhanuzi ntabura icyubahiro, keretse mu gihugu cy'iwabo no mu nzu yabo.”
[58]and he did not work many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
[58]Aho Yesu ntiyakorerayo ibitangaza byinshi abitewe n'uko batamwizeye.

Matthew 14:1-36
Mt 14:1-36
[1]At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the reputation of Jesus
[1]Icyo gihe Umwami Herode yumvise inkuru ya Yesu,
[2]and said to his court, 'This is John the Baptist himself; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.'
[2]abwira abagaragu be ati “Uwo ni Yohana Umubatiza wazutse, ni cyo gituma akora ibitangaza.”
[3]Now it was Herod who had arrested John, chained him up and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
[3]Kuko Herode yari yarafashe Yohana akamuboha, akamushyira mu nzu y'imbohe ku bwa Herodiya wari muka mwene se Filipo,
[4]For John had told him, 'It is against the Law for you to have her.'
[4]kuko Yohana yari yabwiye Herode ati “Amategeko ntiyemera ko umucyura.”
[5]He had wanted to kill him but was afraid of the people, who regarded John as a prophet.
[5]Yifuzaga kumwica ariko atinya abantu, kuko bemeraga ko ari umuhanuzi.
[6]Then, during the celebrations for Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and so delighted Herod
[6]Umunsi wo kwibuka kuvuka kwa Herode usohoye, umukobwa wa Herodiya abyinira imbere y'abararitswe, ashimisha Herode.
[7]that he promised on oath to give her anything she asked.
[7]Ni cyo cyatumye asezerana arahira ko amuha icyo amusaba cyose.
[8]Prompted by her mother she said, 'Give me John the Baptist's head, here, on a dish.'
[8]Na we amaze koshywa na nyina aramubwira ati “Mpa igihanga cya Yohana Umubatiza ku mbehe.”
[9]The king was distressed but, thinking of the oaths he had sworn and of his guests, he ordered it to be given her,
[9]Umwami arababara, ariko ategeka ko bakimuha ku bw'indahiro yarahiriye imbere y'abasangiraga na we,
[10]and sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
[10]atuma mu nzu y'imbohe ngo bace igihanga cya Yohana.
[11]The head was brought in on a dish and given to the girl, who took it to her mother.
[11]Bazana igihanga cye ku mbehe bagiha umukobwa, agishyīra nyina.
[12]John's disciples came and took the body and buried it; then they went off to tell Jesus.
[12]Abigishwa be barazabajyana umurambo, barawuhamba maze bajya kubibwira Yesu.
[13]When Jesus received this news he withdrew by boat to a lonely place where they could be by themselves. But the crowds heard of this and, leaving the towns, went after him on foot.
[13]Yesu abyumvise arahava, agenda mu bwato ajya aho abantu bataba kwiherera. Abantu benshi babyumvise bava mu midugudu baramukurikira, baca iy'ubutaka.
[14]So as he stepped ashore he saw a large crowd; and he took pity on them and healed their sick.
[14]Yomotse abona abantu benshi arabababarira, abakiriza abarwayi.
[15]When evening came, the disciples went to him and said, 'This is a lonely place, and time has slipped by; so send the people away, and they can go to the villages to buy themselves some food.'
[15]Umunsi ukuze, abigishwa be baramwegera bati “Aha ngaha ntihagira abantu none umunsi urakuze, sezerera abantu bajye mu birorero bīhahire ibyokurya.”
[16]Jesus replied, 'There is no need for them to go: give them something to eat yourselves.'
[16]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Ntakibajyanayo, mube ari mwe mubagaburira.”
[17]But they answered, 'All we have with us is five loaves and two fish.'
[17]Baramusubiza bati “Nta cyo dufite hano, keretse imitsima itanu n'ifi ebyiri.”
[18]So he said, 'Bring them here to me.'
[18]Arababwira ati “Nimubinzanire hano.”
[19]He gave orders that the people were to sit down on the grass; then he took the five loaves and the two fish, raised his eyes to heaven and said the blessing. And breaking the loaves he handed them to his disciples, who gave them to the crowds.
[19]Ategeka abantu ko bicara mu byatsi, yenda iyo mitsima itanu n'izo fi ebyiri, arararama areba mu ijuru arabishimira, amanyagura iyo mitsima ayiha abigishwa be, abigishwa bayiha abantu.
[20]They all ate as much as they wanted, and they collected the scraps left over, twelve baskets full.
[20]Bararya bose barahāga, bateranya ubuvungukira bw'imitsima busigaye, bwuzura intonga cumi n'ebyiri.
[21]Now about five thousand men had eaten, to say nothing of women and children.
[21]Abariye bari nk'ibihumbi bitanu, abagore n'abana batabariwemo.
[22]And at once he made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side while he sent the crowds away.
[22]Uwo mwanya ahata abigishwa be ngo bikire mu bwato babanze hakurya, amare gusezerera abantu.
[23]After sending the crowds away he went up into the hills by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,
[23]Amaze kubasezerera aragenda, azamuka umusozi wenyine ajya gusenga. Bwari bugorobye, ari yo wenyine.
[24]while the boat, by now some furlongs from land, was hard pressed by rough waves, for there was a head-wind.
[24]Ariko ubwato bugeze imuhengeri buteraganwa n'umuraba, kuko umuyaga ubaturutse imbere.
[25]In the fourth watch of the night he came towards them, walking on the sea,
[25]Nuko mu nkoko aza aho bari agendesha amaguru hejuru y'inyanja.
[26]and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified. 'It is a ghost,' they said, and cried out in fear.
[26]Ariko abigishwa bamubonye agendesha amaguru hejuru y'inyanja bahagarika imitima, batakishwa n'ubwoba bati “Ni umuzimu.”
[27]But at once Jesus called out to them, saying, 'Courage! It's me! Don't be afraid.'
[27]Ariko uwo mwanya Yesu avugana na bo ati “Nimuhumure ni jyewe, mwitinya.”
[28]It was Peter who answered. 'Lord,' he said, 'if it is you, tell me to come to you across the water.'
[28]Petero aramusubiza ati “Mwami niba ari wowe, untegeke nze aho uri ngendesha amaguru hejuru y'amazi.”
[29]Jesus said, 'Come.' Then Peter got out of the boat and started walking towards Jesus across the water,
[29]Aramusubiza ati “Ngwino.” Petero ava mu bwato, agendesha amaguru hejuru y'amazi ngo asange Yesu.
[30]but then noticing the wind, he took fright and began to sink. 'Lord,' he cried, 'save me!'
[30]Ariko abonye umuyaga ko ari mwinshi aratinya, atangiye kurengerwa arataka ati “Databuja nkiza.”
[31]Jesus put out his hand at once and held him. 'You have so little faith,' he said, 'why did you doubt?'
[31]Uwo mwanya Yesu arambura ukuboko kwe aramufata, aramubwira ati “Yewe ufite kwizera guke we, ni iki gitumye ushidikanya?”
[32]And as they got into the boat the wind dropped.
[32]Baratambuka bajya mu bwato, umuyaga uratuza.
[33]The men in the boat bowed down before him and said, 'Truly, you are the Son of God.'
[33]Abari mu bwato baramupfukamira, baramubwira bati “Ni ukuri uri Umwana w'Imana.”
[34]Having made the crossing, they came to land at Gennesaret.
[34]Nuko bamaze gufata hakurya, bagera imusozi mu gihugu cy'i Genesareti.
[35]When the local people recognised him they spread the news through the whole neighbourhood and took all that were sick to him,
[35]Ab'aho baramumenya, batuma muri icyo gihugu cyose bamuzanira abarwayi bose,
[36]begging him just to let them touch the fringe of his cloak. And all those who touched it were saved.
[36]baramwinginga ngo bakore ku nshunda z'umwenda we gusa, abazikozeho bose barakira.

Matthew 15:1-39
Mt 15:1-39
[1]Then Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said,
[1]Nuko Abafarisayo n'abanditsi bavuye i Yerusalemu baza aho Yesu ari baramubaza bati
[2]'Why do your disciples break away from the tradition of the elders? They eat without washing their hands.'
[2]“Ni iki gituma abigishwa bawe bataziririza imigenzo y'abakera, ntibajabike intoki mu mazi bagiye kurya?”
[3]He answered, 'And why do you break away from the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
[3]Na we arababaza ati “Namwe ni iki gituma mucumurira itegeko ry'Imana imigenzo yanyu?
[4]For God said, "Honour your father and your mother" and "Anyone who curses his father or mother will be put to death."
[4]Kuko Imana yavuze iti ‘Wubahe so na nyoko’, kandi iti ‘Ututse se cyangwa nyina bamwice.’
[5]But you say, "If anyone says to his father or mother: Anything I might have used to help you is dedicated to God,
[5]Ariko mwebweho muravuga muti ‘Umuntu wese ubwira se cyangwa nyina ati: Icyo najyaga kugufashisha nagituye Imana,umeze atyo ntahatwa kubaha se cyangwa nyina.’
[6]he is rid of his duty to father or mother." In this way you have made God's word ineffective by means of your tradition.
[6]Nuko ijambo ry'Imana mwarihinduye ubusa ngo mukomeze imigenzo yanyu.
[7]Hypocrites! How rightly Isaiah prophesied about you when he said:
[7]Mwa ndyarya mwe, Yesaya yahanuye ibyanyu neza ati
[8]This people honours me only with lip-service, while their hearts are far from me.
[8]‘Ubu bwoko bunshimisha iminwa,Ariko imitima yabo imba kure.
[9]Their reverence of me is worthless; the lessons they teach are nothing but human commandments.'
[9]Bansengera ubusa,Kuko inyigisho bigisha ari amategeko y'abantu.’ ”
[10]He called the people to him and said, 'Listen, and understand.
[10]Ahamagara abantu arababwira ati “Nimwumve musobanukirwe.
[11]What goes into the mouth does not make anyone unclean; it is what comes out of the mouth that makes someone unclean.'
[11]Ikijya mu kanwa si cyo gihumanya umuntu, ahubwo ikiva mu kanwa ni cyo kimuhumanya.”
[12]Then the disciples came to him and said, 'Do you know that the Pharisees were shocked when they heard what you said?'
[12]Maze abigishwa baramwegera baramubaza bati “Uzi yuko Abafarisayo barakajwe no kumva ayo magambo?”
[13]He replied, 'Any plant my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.
[13]Arabasubiza ati “Igiti cyose Data wo mu ijuru adateye kizarandurwa.
[14]Leave them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind; and if one blind person leads another, both will fall into a pit.'
[14]Nimubareke ni abarandata impumyi kandi na bo bahumye. Ariko impumyi iyo irandase indi zombi zigwa mu mwobo.”
[15]At this, Peter said to him, 'Explain the parable for us.'
[15]Petero aramusubiza ati “Dusobanurire uwo mugani.”
[16]Jesus replied, 'Even you -- don't you yet understand?
[16]Aramubaza ati “Mbese namwe ntimurajijuka?
[17]Can't you see that whatever goes into the mouth passes through the stomach and is discharged into the sewer?
[17]Ntimuzi yuko ikintu cyose kigiye mu kanwa kijya mu nda kikanyura mu nzira yacyo?
[18]But whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and it is this that makes someone unclean.
[18]Ariko ibiva mu kanwa biba bivuye mu mutima, ni byo bihumanya umuntu.
[19]For from the heart come evil intentions: murder, adultery, fornication, theft, perjury, slander.
[19]Kuko mu mutima w'umuntu ari ho haturuka ibitekerezo bibi: kwica no gusambana no guheheta, kwiba no kubeshyera abandi n'ibitutsi.
[20]These are the things that make a person unclean. But eating with unwashed hands does not make anyone unclean.'
[20]Ibyo ni byo bihumanya umuntu, ariko kurisha intoki zitajabitse mu mazi ntiguhumanya umuntu.”
[21]Jesus left that place and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
[21]Yesu arahava ajya mu gihugu cy'i Tiro n'i Sidoni.
[22]And suddenly out came a Canaanite woman from that district and started shouting, 'Lord, Son of David, take pity on me. My daughter is tormented by a devil.'
[22]Umunyakanānikazi aturuka muri icyo gihugu arataka cyane ati “Mwami mwene Dawidi, mbabarira, umukobwa wanjye atewe na dayimoni cyane.”
[23]But he said not a word in answer to her. And his disciples went and pleaded with him, saying, 'Give her what she wants, because she keeps shouting after us.'
[23]Ntiyagira icyo amusubiza. Nuko abigishwa be baramwegera baramwinginga bati “Musezerere kuko adutakira inyuma.”
[24]He said in reply, 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of the House of Israel.'
[24]Arabasubiza ati “Sinatumiwe abandi, keretse intama zazimiye zo mu muryango wa Isirayeli.”
[25]But the woman had come up and was bowing low before him. 'Lord,' she said, 'help me.'
[25]Na we araza aramupfukamira aramubwira ati “Mwami, ntabara.”
[26]He replied, 'It is not fair to take the children's food and throw it to little dogs.'
[26]Aramusubiza ati “Si byiza kwenda ibyokurya by'abana ngo mbijugunyire imbwa.”
[27]She retorted, 'Ah yes, Lord; but even little dogs eat the scraps that fall from their masters' table.'
[27]Na we ati “Ni koko Mwami, ariko imbwa na zo zirya ubuvungukira bugwa buvuye ku meza ya ba nyirazo.”
[28]Then Jesus answered her, 'Woman, you have great faith. Let your desire be granted.' And from that moment her daughter was well again.
[28]Maze Yesu aramusubiza ati “Mugore, kwizera kwawe ni kwinshi, bikubere uko ushaka.” Umukobwa we aherako arakira.
[29]Jesus went on from there and reached the shores of the Lake of Galilee, and he went up onto the mountain. He took his seat,
[29]Yesu avayo ajya ku Nyanja y'i Galilaya, azamuka umusozi aricara.
[30]and large crowds came to him bringing the lame, the crippled, the blind, the dumb and many others; these they put down at his feet, and he cured them.
[30]Abantu benshi baza aho ari, bazana abacumbagira n'ibirema, n'impumyi n'ibiragi n'abandi barwayi benshi, babarambika hasi imbere ye arabakiza,
[31]The crowds were astonished to see the dumb speaking, the cripples whole again, the lame walking and the blind with their sight, and they praised the God of Israel.
[31]bituma abantu batangara babonye ibiragi bivuga, ibirema ari bizima, abacumbagira bagenda, n'impumyi zireba, bahimbaza Imana y'Abisirayeli.
[32]But Jesus called his disciples to him and said, 'I feel sorry for all these people; they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them off hungry, or they might collapse on the way.'
[32]Yesu ahamagara abigishwa be arababwira ati “Mbabariye abo bantu kuko uyu munsi ari uwa gatatu turi kumwe, none ntibafite ibyokurya. Sinshaka kubasezerera batariye, isari itabatsinda ku nzira.”
[33]The disciples said to him, 'Where in a deserted place could we get sufficient bread for such a large crowd to have enough to eat?'
[33]Abigishwa baramubaza bati “Muri ubu butayu twakura he imitsima ingana ityo yo guhaza abantu bangana batya?”
[34]Jesus said to them, 'How many loaves have you?' They said, 'Seven, and a few small fish.'
[34]Yesu na we arababaza ati “Mufite imitsima ingahe?”Baramusubiza bati “Ni irindwi n'udufi duke.”
[35]Then he instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground,
[35]Ategeka abantu ko bicara hasi.
[36]and he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks he broke them and began handing them to the disciples, who gave them to the crowds.
[36]Yenda iyo mitsima irindwi n'udufi, arabishimira, arabimanyagura, abiha abigishwa be, na bo babiha abantu.
[37]They all ate as much as they wanted, and they collected what was left of the scraps, seven baskets full.
[37]Bose bararya barahaga, bateranya ubuvungukira busigaye, bwuzura ibitebo birindwi.
[38]Now four thousand men had eaten, to say nothing of women and children.
[38]Abariye bari abagabo ibihumbi bine, abagore n'abana batabariwemo.
[39]And when he had sent the crowds away he got into the boat and went to the territory of Magadan.
[39]Asezerera abantu, yikira mu bwato ajya mu gihugu cy'i Magadani.

Matthew 16:1-28
Mt 16:1-28
[1]The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to put him to the test they asked if he would show them a sign from heaven.
[1]Abafarisayo n'Abasadukayo baraza, bamusaba ngo abereke ikimenyetso kivuye mu ijuru, kugira ngo bamugerageze.
[2]He replied, 'In the evening you say, "It will be fine; there's a red sky,"
[2]Arabasubiza ati “Iyo bugorobye, muravuga muti ‘Hazaramuka umucyo kuko ijuru ritukura.’
[3]and in the morning, "Stormy weather today; the sky is red and overcast." You know how to read the face of the sky, but you cannot read the signs of the times.
[3]Na mu gitondo muti ‘Haraba umuvumbi kuko ijuru ritukura kandi ryirabura.’ Muzi kugenzura ijuru uko risa, ariko munanirwa kugenzura ibimenyetso by'ibihe.
[4]It is an evil and unfaithful generation asking for a sign, and the only sign it will be given is the sign of Jonah.' And he left them and went off.
[4]Abantu b'iki gihe kibi bishimira ubusambanyi bashaka ikimenyetso, ariko nta cyo bazahabwa, keretse icya Yona.” Abasiga aho aragenda.
[5]The disciples, having crossed to the other side, had forgotten to take any food.
[5]Abigishwa bajya hakurya ariko bibagiwe kujyana imitsima.
[6]Jesus said to them, 'Keep your eyes open, and be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.'
[6]Yesu arababwira ati “Mumenye, mwirinde umusemburo w'Abafarisayo n'uw'Abasadukayo.”
[7]And they said among themselves, 'It is because we have not brought any bread.'
[7]Bariburanya ubwabo bati “Ni uko tutazanye imitsima.”
[8]Jesus knew it, and he said, 'You have so little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?
[8]Yesu arabimenya arababaza ati “Mwa bafite kwizera guke mwe, igitumye mwiburanya ubwanyu ni uko mudafite imitsima?
[9]Do you still not understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand and the number of baskets you collected?
[9]Ntimurajijuka, ntimwibuka ya mitsima itanu ku bantu ibihumbi bitanu, mwujuje intonga zingahe?
[10]Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and the number of baskets you collected?
[10]Cyangwa ya mitsima irindwi ku bantu ibihumbi bine, mwujuje ibitebo bingahe?
[11]How could you fail to understand that I was not talking about bread? What I said was: Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.'
[11]Ni iki kibabujije kumenya yuko ntababwiye iby'imitsima? Keretse ko mwirinda umusemburo w'Abafarisayo n'uw'Abasadukayo.”
[12]Then they understood that he was telling them to be on their guard, not against yeast for making bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
[12]Nuko bamenya yuko atababwiye ko birinda umusemburo w'imitsima, ahubwo ko birinda imyigishirize y'Abafarisayo n'iy'Abasadukayo.
[13]When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi he put this question to his disciples, 'Who do people say the Son of man is?'
[13]Nuko Yesu ajya mu gihugu cy'i Kayisariya ya Filipo abaza abigishwa be ati “Abantu bagira ngo Umwana w'umuntu ndi nde?”
[14]And they said, 'Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.'
[14]Baramusubiza bati “Bamwe bagira ngo uri Yohana Umubatiza, abandi ngo uri Eliya, abandi ngo uri Yeremiya, cyangwa ngo uri umwe wo mu bahanuzi.”
[15]'But you,' he said, 'who do you say I am?'
[15]Arababaza ati “Ariko mwebwe ubwanyu mugira ngo ndi nde?”
[16]Then Simon Peter spoke up and said, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.'
[16]Simoni Petero aramusubiza ati “Uri Kristo, Umwana w'Imana ihoraho.”
[17]Jesus replied, 'Simon son of Jonah, you are a blessed man! Because it was no human agency that revealed this to you but my Father in heaven.
[17]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Urahirwa Simoni wa Yona, kuko umubiri n'amaraso atari byo byabiguhishuriye, ahubwo ni Data wo mu ijuru.
[18]So I now say to you: You are Peter and on this rock I will build my community. And the gates of the underworld can never overpower it.
[18]Nanjye ndakubwira nti ‘Uri Petero, kandi nzubaka Itorero ryanjye kuri urwo rutare, kandi amarembo y'ikuzimu ntazarishobora.’
[19]I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.'
[19]Nzaguha imfunguzo z'ubwami bwo mu ijuru, kandi icyo uzahambira mu isi kizaba gihambiriwe mu ijuru, n'icyo uzahambura mu isi kizaba gihambuwe mu ijuru.”
[20]Then he gave the disciples strict orders not to say to anyone that he was the Christ.
[20]Maze yihanangiriza abigishwa ngo batagira uwo babwira ko ari we Kristo.
[21]From then onwards Jesus began to make it clear to his disciples that he was destined to go to Jerusalem and suffer grievously at the hands of the elders and chief priests and scribes and to be put to death and to be raised up on the third day.
[21]Yesu aherako yigisha abigishwa be ko akwiriye kujya i Yerusalemu, akababazwa uburyo bwinshi n'abakuru n'abatambyi bakuru n'abanditsi, akicwa, akazazurwa ku munsi wa gatatu.
[22]Then, taking him aside, Peter started to rebuke him. 'Heaven preserve you, Lord,' he said, 'this must not happen to you.'
[22]Petero aramwihererana atangira kumuhana ati “Biragatsindwa Mwami, ibyo ntibizakubaho na hato.”
[23]But he turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan! You are an obstacle in my path, because you are thinking not as God thinks but as human beings do.'
[23]Arahindukira abwira Petero ati “Subira inyuma yanjye Satani, umbereye igisitaza kuko ibyo utekereza atari iby'Imana, ahubwo utekereza iby'abantu.”
[24]Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'If anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let him renounce himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[24]Maze Yesu abwira abigishwa be ati “Umuntu nashaka kunkurikira yiyange, yikorere umusaraba we ankurikire,
[25]Anyone who wants to save his life will lose it; but anyone who loses his life for my sake will find it.
[25]kuko ushaka kurengera ubugingo bwe azabubura, ariko utita ku bugingo bwe ku bwanjye, azabubona.
[26]What, then, will anyone gain by winning the whole world and forfeiting his life? Or what can anyone offer in exchange for his life?
[26]Kandi umuntu byamumarira iki gutunga ibintu byose byo mu isi, niyakwa ubugingo bwe? Cyangwa umuntu yatanga iki gucungura ubugingo bwe?
[27]'For the Son of man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will reward each one according to his behaviour.
[27]Kuko Umwana w'umuntu azazana n'abamarayika be afite ubwiza bwa Se, agaherako yitura umuntu wese ibikwiriye ibyo yakoze.
[28]In truth I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of man coming with his kingdom.'
[28]Ndababwira ukuri yuko muri aba bahagaze hano harimo bamwe batazapfa, kugeza ubwo bazabona Umwana w'umuntu aziye mu bwami bwe.”

Matthew 17:1-20,22-27
Mt 17:1-27
[1]Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
[1]Iminsi itandatu ishize, Yesu ajyana Petero na Yakobo na Yohana mwene se, bajyana mu mpinga y'umusozi muremure bonyine.
[2]There in their presence he was transfigured: his face shone like the sun and his clothes became as dazzling as light.
[2]Ahindurirwa imbere yabo, mu maso he harabagirana nk'izuba, imyenda ye yera nk'umucyo.
[3]And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them; they were talking with him.
[3]Maze Mose na Eliya barababonekera bavugana na we.
[4]Then Peter spoke to Jesus. 'Lord,' he said, 'it is wonderful for us to be here; if you want me to, I will make three shelters here, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.'
[4]Petero abwira Yesu ati “Mwami, ni byiza ubwo turi hano. Nushaka ndaca ingando eshatu hano, imwe yawe, indi ya Mose, indi ya Eliya.”
[5]He was still speaking when suddenly a bright cloud covered them with shadow, and suddenly from the cloud there came a voice which said, 'This is my Son, the Beloved; he enjoys my favour. Listen to him.'
[5]Akibivuga igicu kirabakingiriza, ijwi rikivugiramo riti “Nguyu Umwana wanjye nkunda nkamwishimira, mumwumvire.”
[6]When they heard this, the disciples fell on their faces, overcome with fear.
[6]Abigishwa babyumvise bikubita hasi bubamye, baratinya cyane.
[7]But Jesus came up and touched them, saying, 'Stand up, do not be afraid.'
[7]Yesu arabegera abakoraho arababwira ati “Nimuhaguruke mwitinya.”
[8]And when they raised their eyes they saw no one but Jesus.
[8]Bubura amaso ntibagira undi babona, keretse Yesu wenyine.
[9]As they came down from the mountain Jesus gave them this order, 'Tell no one about this vision until the Son of man has risen from the dead.'
[9]Bakimanuka umusozi, Yesu arabihanangiriza ati “Ntihagire umuntu mubwira ibyo mweretswe, kugeza aho Umwana w'umuntu azazukira.”
[10]And the disciples put this question to him, 'Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?'
[10]Abigishwa be baramubaza bati “Ni iki gituma abanditsi bavuga bati ‘Eliya akwiriye kubanza kuza’?”
[11]He replied, 'Elijah is indeed coming, and he will set everything right again;
[11]Arabasubiza ati “Ni ukuri ko Eliya akwiriye kubanza kuza, akagarura byose akabitunganya.
[12]however, I tell you that Elijah has come already and they did not recognise him but treated him as they pleased; and the Son of man will suffer similarly at their hands.'
[12]Ariko ndababwira yuko Eliya yaje ntibamumenya, ahubwo bamugira uko bashaka. N'Umwana w'umuntu ni ko bazamugira.”
[13]Then the disciples understood that he was speaking of John the Baptist.
[13]Nuko abigishwa bamenya yuko ababwiye ibya Yohana Umubatiza.
[14]As they were rejoining the crowd a man came up to him and went down on his knees before him.
[14]Bageze mu bantu, umuntu araza aramwegera, aramupfukamira aramubwira ati
[15]'Lord,' he said, 'take pity on my son: he is demented and in a wretched state; he is always falling into fire and into water.
[15]“Mwami, babarira umuhungu wanjye kuko arwaye igicuri, kiramubabaza cyane kuko kenshi cyane kimutura mu muriro no mu mazi.
[16]I took him to your disciples and they were unable to cure him.'
[16]Namuzaniye abigishwa bawe ntibabasha kumukiza.”
[17]In reply, Jesus said, 'Faithless and perverse generation! How much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.'
[17]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Yemwe bantu b'iki gihe biyobagiza batizera, nzageza he kubana namwe? Nzabihanganira kugeza ryari? Nimumunzanire hano.”
[18]And when Jesus rebuked it the devil came out of the boy, who was cured from that moment.
[18]Yesu aramucyaha, dayimoni amuvamo, umuhungu aherako arakira.
[19]Then the disciples came privately to Jesus. 'Why were we unable to drive it out?' they asked.
[19]Maze abigishwa begera Yesu biherereye bati “Ni iki cyatumye twebwe bitunanira kumwirukana?”
[20]He answered, 'Because you have so little faith. In truth I tell you, if your faith is the size of a mustard seed you will say to this mountain, "Move from here to there," and it will move; nothing will be impossible for you.'
[20]Arabasubiza ati “Ni ukwizera kwanyu guke: ndababwira ukuri yuko mwaba mufite kwizera kungana n'akabuto ka sinapi, mwabwira uyu musozi muti ‘Va hano ujye hirya’ wahava, kandi ntakizabananira. [
[21]
[21]Ariko bene uwo ntavanwamo n'ikindi keretse gusenga no kwiyiriza ubusa.]”
[22]When they were together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of man is going to be delivered into the power of men;
[22]Bakigenda i Galilaya, Yesu arababwira ati “Umwana w'umuntu arenda kuzagambanirwa afatwe n'abantu,
[23]they will put him to death, and on the third day he will be raised up again.' And a great sadness came over them.
[23]bazamwica maze ku munsi wa gatatu azurwe.”Barababara cyane.
[24]When they reached Capernaum, the collectors of the half-shekel came to Peter and said, 'Does your master not pay the half-shekel?'
[24]Bagera i Kaperinawumu, abantu basoresha umusoro w'ididarakama baza aho Petero ari baramubaza bati “Mbese umwigisha wanyu ntatanga ididarakama?”
[25]'Yes,' he replied, and went into the house. But before he could speak, Jesus said, 'Simon, what is your opinion? From whom do earthly kings take toll or tribute? From their sons or from foreigners?'
[25]Arabasubiza ati “Arayitanga.”Yinjiye mu nzu, Yesu aramutanguranwa aramubaza ati “Utekereza ute, Simoni? Abami bo mu isi abo baka umusoro n'ihoro ni abahe? Ni abana babo cyangwa ni rubanda?”
[26]And when he replied, 'From foreigners,' Jesus said, 'Well then, the sons are exempt.
[26]Aramusubiza ati “Ni rubanda.”Yesu aramubwira ati “Nuko rero abana bo bibereye mu mudendezo.
[27]However, so that we shall not be the downfall of others, go to the lake and cast a hook; take the first fish that rises, open its mouth and there you will find a shekel; take it and give it to them for me and for yourself.'
[27]Ariko kugira ngo tutababera igisitaza, jya ku nyanja ujugunyemo ururobo, ifi uri bubanze gufata uyende, uyasamure urasangamo sitateri, uyijyane uyibahe ku bwanjye no ku bwawe.”

Matthew 18:1-35
Mt 18:1-35
[1]At this time the disciples came to Jesus and said, 'Who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven?'
[1]Icyo gihe abigishwa begera Yesu baramubaza bati “Umukuru mu bwami bwo mu ijuru ni nde?”
[2]So he called a little child to him whom he set among them.
[2]Ahamagara umwana muto amuhagarika hagati yabo,
[3]Then he said, 'In truth I tell you, unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of Heaven.
[3]arababwira ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko nimudahinduka ngo mumere nk'abana bato, mutazinjira mu bwami bwo mu ijuru.
[4]And so, the one who makes himself as little as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven.
[4]Nuko uzicisha bugufi nk'uyu mwana muto, ni we mukuru mu bwami bwo mu ijuru.
[5]'Anyone who welcomes one little child like this in my name welcomes me.
[5]Uwemera umwana umwe muto nk'uyu mu izina ryanjye, ni jye aba yemeye.
[6]But anyone who is the downfall of one of these little ones who have faith in me would be better drowned in the depths of the sea with a great millstone round his neck.
[6]“Ariko ushuka umwe muri aba bato banyizera akamugusha, ikiruta ni uko yahambirwa urusyo mu ijosi rye, akazikwa imuhengeri mu nyanja.
[7]Alas for the world that there should be such causes of falling! Causes of falling indeed there must be, but alas for anyone who provides them!
[7]Isi izaboneshwa ishyano n'ibigusha abantu, kuko ibyo bigusha bitazabura kuza, ariko uwo muntu uzana ibigusha azabona ishyano.
[8]'If your hand or your foot should be your downfall, cut it off and throw it away: it is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
[8]“Ariko ukuboko kwawe cyangwa ukuguru kwawe nibigucumuza uguce ugute kure yawe. Ibyiza ni uko wakwinjira mu bugingo usigaranye ukuboko kumwe cyangwa ukuguru, biruta ko wajugunywa mu muriro utazima ufite amaboko yombi cyangwa amaguru yombi.
[9]And if your eye should be your downfall, tear it out and throw it away: it is better for you to enter into life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell of fire.
[9]Cyangwa ijisho ryawe nirikugusha urinogore urite kure yawe. Ibyiza ni uko wakwinjira mu bugingo usigaranye ijisho rimwe gusa, biruta ko wajugunywa muri Gehinomu y'umuriro ufite amaso yombi.
[10]'See that you never despise any of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven are continually in the presence of my Father in heaven.
[10]“Mwirinde mudasuzugura umwe muri aba bana bato. Ndababwira yuko abamarayika babo bo mu ijuru bahora bareba mu maso ha Data wo mu ijuru. [
[11]
[11]Umwana w'umuntu yaje gukiza icyari cyazimiye.]
[12]'Tell me. Suppose a man has a hundred sheep and one of them strays; will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hillside and go in search of the stray?
[12]“Mbese muratekereza mute? Umuntu ufite intama ijana, imwe muri zo iyo izimiye ntasiga izo mirongo urwenda n'icyenda, akajya ku misozi agashaka iyazimiye?
[13]In truth I tell you, if he finds it, it gives him more joy than do the ninety-nine that did not stray at all.
[13]Kandi iyo ayibonye, ndababwira ukuri yuko ayishimira cyane kurusha izo mirongo urwenda n'icyenda zitazimiye.
[14]Similarly, it is never the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost.
[14]Nuko So wo mu ijuru ntashaka ko hagira n'umwe muri aba bato urimbuka.
[15]'If your brother does something wrong, go and have it out with him alone, between your two selves. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother.
[15]“Mwene so nakugirira nabi, ugende umumenyeshe icyaha cye mwiherereye, nakumvira uzaba ubonye mwene so.
[16]If he does not listen, take one or two others along with you: whatever the misdemeanour, the evidence of two or three witnesses is required to sustain the charge.
[16]Ariko natakumvira umuteze undi cyangwa babiri, ngo ‘Ijambo ryose rikomere mu kanwa k'abagabo babiri cyangwa batatu.’
[17]But if he refuses to listen to these, report it to the community; and if he refuses to listen to the community, treat him like a gentile or a tax collector.
[17]Kandi niyanga kumvira abo uzabibwire Itorero, niyanga kuryumvira na ryo, azakubeho nk'umupagani cyangwa umukoresha w'ikoro.
[18]'In truth I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
[18]“Ndababwira ukuri yuko ibyo muzahambira mu isi bizaba bihambiriwe mu ijuru, kandi ibyo muzahambura mu isi bizaba bihambuwe mu ijuru.
[19]'In truth I tell you once again, if two of you on earth agree to ask anything at all, it will be granted to you by my Father in heaven.
[19]“Kandi ndababwira yuko ababiri muri mwe nibahuza umutima mu isi wo kugira icyo basaba cyose, bazagikorerwa na Data wo mu ijuru.
[20]For where two or three meet in my name, I am there among them.'
[20]Kuko aho babiri cyangwa batatu bateraniye mu izina ryanjye, nanjye mba ndi hagati yabo.”
[21]Then Peter went up to him and said, 'Lord, how often must I forgive my brother if he wrongs me? As often as seven times?'
[21]Nuko Petero aramwegera aramubaza ati “Databuja, mwene data nangirira nabi nzamubabarira kangahe? Ngeze karindwi?”
[22]Jesus answered, 'Not seven, I tell you, but seventy-seven times.
[22]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Sinkubwiye yuko ugeza karindwi, ahubwo yuko ugeza mirongo irindwi karindwi.
[23]'And so the kingdom of Heaven may be compared to a king who decided to settle his accounts with his servants.
[23]Ni cyo gituma ubwami bwo mu ijuru bwagereranywa n'umwami washatse kubarana n'abagaragu be umubare w'ibyo yababikije.
[24]When the reckoning began, they brought him a man who owed ten thousand talents;
[24]Abanje kubara, bamuzanira umwe muri bo yishyuza italanto inzovu.
[25]he had no means of paying, so his master gave orders that he should be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions, to meet the debt.
[25]Ariko kuko yari adafite ibyo kwishyura, shebuja ategeka kumugura n'umugore we n'abana be n'ibyo afite byose, ngo umwenda ushire.
[26]At this, the servant threw himself down at his master's feet, with the words, "Be patient with me and I will pay the whole sum."
[26]Umugaragu aramupfukamira aramwinginga ati ‘Mwami, nyihanganira nzakwishyura byose.’
[27]And the servant's master felt so sorry for him that he let him go and cancelled the debt.
[27]Shebuja aramubabarira aramureka, amuharira umwenda.
[28]Now as this servant went out, he happened to meet a fellow-servant who owed him one hundred denarii; and he seized him by the throat and began to throttle him, saying, "Pay what you owe me."
[28]“Ariko uwo mugaragu arasohoka, asanga umugaragu mugenzi we yagurije idenariyo ijana, aramufata aramuniga, aramubwira ati ‘Nyishyura umwenda wanjye.’
[29]His fellow-servant fell at his feet and appealed to him, saying, "Be patient with me and I will pay you."
[29]Umugaragu mugenzi we yikubita hasi, aramwinginga ati ‘Nyihanganira nzakwishyura.’
[30]But the other would not agree; on the contrary, he had him thrown into prison till he should pay the debt.
[30]Ntiyakunda maze aragenda amushyira mu nzu y'imbohe, kugeza aho azamarira kwishyura umwenda.
[31]His fellow-servants were deeply distressed when they saw what had happened, and they went to their master and reported the whole affair to him.
[31]Abagaragu bagenzi be babonye ibibaye barababara cyane, baragenda babibwira shebuja uko bibaye byose.
[32]Then the master sent for the man and said to him, "You wicked servant, I cancelled all that debt of yours when you appealed to me.
[32]Maze shebuja aramuhamagara aramubwira ati ‘Wa mugaragu mubi we, naguhariye wa mwenda wose kuko wanyinginze,
[33]Were you not bound, then, to have pity on your fellow-servant just as I had pity on you?"
[33]nawe ntiwari ukwiriye kubabarira mugenzi wawe nk'uko nakubabariye?’
[34]And in his anger the master handed him over to the torturers till he should pay all his debt.
[34]Shebuja ararakara, amuha abasirikare kugeza aho azamarira kwishyura umwenda wose.
[35]And that is how my heavenly Father will deal with you unless you each forgive your brother from your heart.'
[35]“Na Data wo mu ijuru ni ko azabagira, nimutababarira umuntu wese mwene so mubikuye mu mutima.”

Matthew 19:1-30
Mt 19:1-30
[1]Jesus had now finished what he wanted to say, and he left Galilee and came into the territory of Judaea on the far side of the Jordan.
[1]Yesu arangije ayo magambo ava i Galilaya, ajya mu gihugu cy'i Yudaya hakurya ya Yorodani.
[2]Large crowds followed him and he healed them there.
[2]Abantu benshi baramukurikira, abakirizayo.
[3]Some Pharisees approached him, and to put him to the test they said, 'Is it against the Law for a man to divorce his wife on any pretext whatever?'
[3]Abafarisayo baza aho ari baramugerageza, baramubaza bati “Mbese amategeko yemera ko umuntu asenda umugore we amuhora ikintu cyose?”
[4]He answered, 'Have you not read that the Creator from the beginning made them male and female
[4]Na we arabasubiza ati “Ntimwari mwasoma yuko Iyabaremye mbere yaremye umugabo n'umugore,
[5]and that he said: This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes attached to his wife, and the two become one flesh?
[5]ikababwira iti ‘Ni cyo gituma umuntu azasiga se na nyina akabana n'umugore we akaramata, bombi bakaba umubiri umwe’?
[6]They are no longer two, therefore, but one flesh. So then, what God has united, human beings must not divide.'
[6]Bituma batakiri babiri, ahubwo babaye umubiri umwe. Nuko icyo Imana yateranyije hamwe, umuntu ntakagitandukanye.”
[7]They said to him, 'Then why did Moses command that a writ of dismissal should be given in cases of divorce?'
[7]Baramubaza bati “Niba ari uko, ni iki cyatumye Mose ategeka ko umugabo aha umugore urwandiko rwo kumusenda, abone uko yamwirukana?”
[8]He said to them, 'It was because you were so hard-hearted, that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but it was not like this from the beginning.
[8]Arabasubiza ati “Mose yabemereye gusenda abagore banyu kuko imitima yanyu inangiye, ariko uhereye mbere hose ntibyari bimeze bityo.
[9]Now I say this to you: anyone who divorces his wife -- I am not speaking of an illicit marriage -- and marries another, is guilty of adultery.'
[9]Ariko ndababwira yuko umuntu wese uzasenda umugore we atamuhora gusambana, akarongora undi azaba asambanye. Kandi ucyura uwasenzwe na we aba asambanye.”
[10]The disciples said to him, 'If that is how things are between husband and wife, it is advisable not to marry.'
[10]Abigishwa be baramubwira bati “Iby'umugabo n'umugore we niba bigenda bityo, noneho kurongora si byiza.”
[11]But he replied, 'It is not everyone who can accept what I have said, but only those to whom it is granted.
[11]Na we arababwira ati “Abantu bose ntibabasha kwemera iryo jambo, keretse ababihawe.
[12]There are eunuchs born so from their mother's womb, there are eunuchs made so by human agency and there are eunuchs who have made themselves so for the sake of the kingdom of Heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.'
[12]Kuko hariho ibiremba byavutse bityo mu nda za ba nyina, hariho n'inkone zakonwe n'abantu, hariho n'inkone zīkona ubwazo ku bw'ubwami bwo mu ijuru. Ubasha kubyemera abyemere.”
[13]Then people brought little children to him, for him to lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples scolded them,
[13]Maze bamuzanira abana bato ngo abarambikeho ibiganza abasabire, abigishwa barabacyaha.
[14]but Jesus said, 'Let the little children alone, and do not stop them from coming to me; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of Heaven belongs.'
[14]Ariko Yesu arababwira ati “Mureke abana bato ntimubabuze kunsanga, kuko abameze batyo ubwami bwo mu ijuru ari ubwabo.”
[15]Then he laid his hands on them and went on his way.
[15]Amaze kubarambikaho ibiganza, avayo.
[16]And now a man came to him and asked, 'Master, what good deed must I do to possess eternal life?'
[16]Nuko umuntu aza aho ari aramubaza ati “Mwigisha mwiza, nkore cyiza ki ngo mpabwe ubugingo buhoraho?”
[17]Jesus said to him, 'Why do you ask me about what is good? There is one alone who is good. But if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.'
[17]Na we aramusubiza ati“Unyitira iki mwiza? Umwiza ni umwe gusa, ni Imana. Ariko nushaka kugera ku bugingo, witondere amategeko.”
[18]He said, 'Which ones?' Jesus replied, 'These: You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false witness.
[18]Aramubaza ati “Ni ayahe?”Yesu aramusubiza ati “Ntukice, ntugasambane, ntukibe, ntukabeshyere abandi,
[19]Honour your father and your mother. You shall love your neighbour as yourself.'
[19]wubahe so na nyoko, ukunde mugenzi wawe nk'uko wikunda.”
[20]The young man said to him, 'I have kept all these. What more do I need to do?'
[20]Uwo muhungu aramubwira ati “Ayo yose narayitondeye. None icyo nshigaje ni iki?”
[21]Jesus said, 'If you wish to be perfect, go and sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.'
[21]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Nushaka kuba utunganye rwose, genda ugurishe ibyo utunze maze uhe abakene, ni bwo uzagira ubutunzi mu ijuru, uhereko uze unkurikire.”
[22]But when the young man heard these words he went away sad, for he was a man of great wealth.
[22]Uwo musore yumvise iryo jambo agenda afite agahinda, kuko yari afite ubutunzi bwinshi.
[23]Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'In truth I tell you, it is hard for someone rich to enter the kingdom of Heaven.
[23]Yesu abwira abigishwa be ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko biruhije ko umutunzi yinjira mu bwami bwo mu ijuru.
[24]Yes, I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone rich to enter the kingdom of Heaven.'
[24]Ndetse ndababwira yuko icyoroshye ari uko ingamiya yanyura mu zuru ry'urushinge, kuruta ko umutunzi yakwinjira mu bwami bwo mu ijuru.”
[25]When the disciples heard this they were astonished. 'Who can be saved, then?' they said.
[25]Abigishwa babyumvise barumirwa cyane bati “Ubwo bimeze bityo, ni nde ushobora gukizwa?”
[26]Jesus gazed at them. 'By human resources', he told them, 'this is impossible; for God everything is possible.'
[26]Yesu arabitegereza arababwira ati “Ibyo ntibishobokera abantu, ariko ku Mana byose birashoboka.”
[27]Then Peter answered and said, 'Look, we have left everything and followed you. What are we to have, then?'
[27]Maze Petero aramubaza ati “Dore twebwe ko twasize byose tukagukurikira, none se tuzamera dute?”
[28]Jesus said to them, 'In truth I tell you, when everything is made new again and the Son of man is seated on his throne of glory, you yourselves will sit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
[28]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko mwebwe abankurikiye, mu gihe cyo guhindura byose ngo bibe bishya, ubwo Umwana w'umuntu azicara ku ntebe y'icyubahiro cye, namwe muzicara ku ntebe cumi n'ebyiri, mucire imiryango cumi n'ibiri y'Abisirayeli imanza.
[29]And everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children or land for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much, and also inherit eternal life.
[29]Umuntu wese wasize urugo cyangwa bene se cyangwa bashiki be, cyangwa se cyangwa nyina cyangwa abana, cyangwa amasambu ku bw'izina ryanjye, azahabwa ibibiruta incuro ijana, kandi azaragwa n'ubugingo buhoraho.
[30]'Many who are first will be last, and the last, first.'
[30]Ariko benshi b'imbere bazaba ab'inyuma, kandi ab'inyuma bazaba ab'imbere.

Matthew 20:1-34
Mt 20:1-34
[1]'Now the kingdom of Heaven is like a landowner going out at daybreak to hire workers for his vineyard.
[1]“Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bwagereranywa n'umuntu ufite urugo, yazindutse kare gushaka abahinzi ngo bahingire uruzabibu rwe.
[2]He made an agreement with the workers for one denarius a day and sent them to his vineyard.
[2]Asezerana n'abahinzi idenariyo ku munsi umwe, abohereza mu ruzabibu rwe.
[3]Going out at about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the market place
[3]Isaha eshatu arasohoka, asanga abandi bahagaze mu iguriro nta cyo bakora,
[4]and said to them, "You go to my vineyard too and I will give you a fair wage."
[4]na bo arababwira ati ‘Namwe mujye mu ruzabibu rwanjye ndi bubahe ibikwiriye.’
[5]So they went. At about the sixth hour and again at about the ninth hour, he went out and did the same.
[5]Baragenda. Yongera gusohoka mu isaha esheshatu n'isaha cyenda, abigenza atyo.
[6]Then at about the eleventh hour he went out and found more men standing around, and he said to them, "Why have you been standing here idle all day?"
[6]Isaha zibaye cumi n'imwe arasohoka, asanga abandi bahagaze arababaza ati ‘Ni iki kibahagaritse hano umunsi wose nta cyo mukora?’
[7]"Because no one has hired us," they answered. He said to them, "You go into my vineyard too."
[7]Baramusubiza bati ‘Kuko ari nta waduhaye umurimo.’ Arababwira ati ‘Namwe mujye mu ruzabibu rwanjye.’
[8]In the evening, the owner of the vineyard said to his bailiff, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last arrivals and ending with the first."
[8]“Bugorobye nyir'uruzabibu abwira igisonga cye ati ‘Hamagara abahinzi ubahe ibihembo byabo, utangirire ku ba nyuma ugeze ku ba mbere.’
[9]So those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came forward and received one denarius each.
[9]Abatangiye mu isaha cumi n'imwe baje, umuntu wese ahabwa idenariyo imwe.
[10]When the first came, they expected to get more, but they too received one denarius each.
[10]Ababanje baje bibwira ko bahembwa ibirutaho, ariko umuntu wese ahembwa idenariyo imwe.
[11]They took it, but grumbled at the landowner saying,
[11]Bazihawe bitotombera nyir'uruzabibu bati
[12]"The men who came last have done only one hour, and you have treated them the same as us, though we have done a heavy day's work in all the heat."
[12]‘Aba ba nyuma bakoze isaha imwe, ubanganyije natwe abahingitse umunsi wose tuvunika, twicwa n'izuba!’
[13]He answered one of them and said, "My friend, I am not being unjust to you; did we not agree on one denarius?
[13]“Na we asubiza umwe muri bo ati ‘Mugenzi wanjye, sinkugiriye nabi. Ntuzi ko twasezeranye idenariyo imwe?
[14]Take your earnings and go. I choose to pay the lastcomer as much as I pay you.
[14]Ngiyo yijyane ugende. Ko nshatse guhemba uwa nyuma nkawe,
[15]Have I no right to do what I like with my own? Why should you be envious because I am generous?"
[15]mbese hari icyambuza kugenza ibyanjye uko nshaka, ko undeba igitsure, kuko ngize ubuntu!’
[16]Thus the last will be first, and the first, last.'
[16]“Uko ni ko ab'inyuma bazaba ab'imbere, kandi ab'imbere bazaba ab'inyuma.”
[17]Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, and on the road he took the Twelve aside by themselves and said to them,
[17]Yesu yenda kuzamuka ngo ajye i Yerusalemu, yihererana n'abo cumi na babiri, ababwirira mu nzira ati
[18]'Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man is about to be handed over to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn him to death
[18]“Dore turazamuka tujya i Yerusalemu, Umwana w'umuntu azagambanirwa mu batambyi bakuru n'abanditsi, bamucire urubanza rwo kumwica.
[19]and will hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified; and on the third day he will be raised up again.'
[19]Bazamugambanira mu bapagani bamushinyagurire, bamukubite imikoba bamubambe, ku munsi wa gatatu azazurwa.”
[20]Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came with her sons to make a request of him, and bowed low;
[20]Maze nyina wa bene Zebedayo azana n'abana be aho ari, aramupfukamira ngo agire icyo amusaba.
[21]and he said to her, 'What is it you want?' She said to him, 'Promise that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom.'
[21]Na we aramubaza ati “Urashaka iki?”Aramusubiza ati “Tegeka ko aba bana banjye bombi bazicara mu bwami bwawe, umwe iburyo bwawe undi ibumoso.”
[22]Jesus answered, 'You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?' They replied, 'We can.'
[22]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Ntimuzi icyo musaba. Mwabasha kunywera ku gikombe nzanyweraho?”Bati “Turabibasha.”
[23]He said to them, 'Very well; you shall drink my cup, but as for seats at my right hand and my left, these are not mine to grant; they belong to those to whom they have been allotted by my Father.'
[23]Arababwira ati “Ni ukuri igikombe cyanjye muzakinyweraho, ariko kwicara iburyo bwanjye n'ibumoso si jye ubigaba, keretse abo Data yabitunganyirije.”
[24]When the other ten heard this they were indignant with the two brothers.
[24]Ba bandi cumi babyumvise barakarira abo bavandimwe bombi.
[25]But Jesus called them to him and said, 'You know that among the gentiles the rulers lord it over them, and great men make their authority felt.
[25]Yesu arabahamagara arababwira ati “Muzi yuko abami b'abanyamahanga babatwaza igitugu, n'abakomeye babo bahawe kubategeka.
[26]Among you this is not to happen. No; anyone who wants to become great among you must be your servant,
[26]Ariko muri mwe si ko biri, ahubwo ushaka kuba mukuru muri mwe ajye aba umugaragu wanyu,
[27]and anyone who wants to be first among you must be your slave,
[27]kandi ushaka kuba uw'imbere muri mwe, ajye aba imbata yanyu,
[28]just as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.'
[28]nk'uko Umwana w'umuntu ataje gukorerwa, ahubwo yaje gukorera abandi no gutangira ubugingo bwe kuba incungu ya benshi.”
[29]As they left Jericho a large crowd followed him.
[29]Bakiva i Yeriko, abantu benshi baramukurikira.
[30]And now there were two blind men sitting at the side of the road. When they heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, they shouted, 'Lord! Have pity on us, son of David.'
[30]Impumyi ebyiri zari zicaye iruhande rw'inzira, zumvise yuko Yesu ahanyura, zirataka cyane ziti “Mwami mwene Dawidi, tubabarire.”
[31]And the crowd scolded them and told them to keep quiet, but they only shouted the louder, 'Lord! Have pity on us, son of David.'
[31]Abantu barazicyaha ngo zihore, ariko zirushaho gutaka ziti “Mwami mwene Dawidi, tubabarire.”
[32]Jesus stopped, called them over and said, 'What do you want me to do for you?'
[32]Yesu arahagarara arazihamagara, arazibaza ati “Murashaka ko mbagirira nte?”
[33]They said to him, 'Lord, let us have our sight back.'
[33]Ziramusubiza ziti “Mwami, amaso yacu ahumuke.”
[34]Jesus felt pity for them and touched their eyes, and at once their sight returned and they followed him.
[34]Yesu azigirira imbabazi akora ku maso yazo, uwo mwanya zirahumuka, baramukurikira.

Matthew 21:1-46
Mt 21:1-11,0,12-46
[1]When they were near Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
[1]Bageze bugufi bw'i Yerusalemu, bajya i Betifage ku musozi wa Elayono, maze Yesu atuma abigishwa babiri
[2]saying to them, 'Go to the village facing you, and you will at once find a tethered donkey and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.
[2]arababwira ati “Mujye mu kirorero kiri imbere, uwo mwanya muri bubone indogobe izirikanye n'iyayo, muziziture muzinzanire.
[3]If anyone says anything to you, you are to say, "The Master needs them and will send them back at once." '
[3]Ariko nihagira umuntu ubabaza ijambo, mumubwire muti ‘Databuja ni we uzishaka’, maze araherako azibahe.”
[4]This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet:
[4]Ibyo byabereyeho kugira ngo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi bisohore ngo
[5]Say to the daughter of Zion: Look, your king is approaching, humble and riding on a donkey and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.
[5]“Mubwire umukobwa w'i Siyoni muti‘Dore umwami wawe aje aho uri,Ari uw'ineza ahetswe n'indogobe,N'icyana cy'indogobe.’ ”
[6]So the disciples went and did as Jesus had told them.
[6]Ba bigishwa baragenda bakora nk'uko Yesu yabategetse,
[7]They brought the donkey and the colt, then they laid their cloaks on their backs and he took his seat on them.
[7]bazana indogobe n'iyayo baziteguraho imyenda yabo, ayicaraho.
[8]Great crowds of people spread their cloaks on the road, while others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in his path.
[8]Haza rubanda rwinshi, abenshi muri bo basasa imyenda yabo mu nzira, abandi baca amashami y'ibiti bayasasa mu nzira.
[9]The crowds who went in front of him and those who followed were all shouting: Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heavens!
[9]Itara ry'abantu bamushagaye bararangurura bati “Hoziyana mwene Dawidi, hahirwa uje mu izina ry'Uwiteka! Hoziyana ahasumba hose!”
[10]And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil as people asked, 'Who is this?'
[10]Ageze i Yerusalemu ab'umurwa bose barashika, barabaza bati “Uriya ni nde?”
[11]and the crowds answered, 'This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.'
[11]Barabasubiza bati “Ni umuhanuzi Yesu w'i Nazareti y'i Galilaya.” [0](Mar 11.15-18; Luka 19.45-48; Yoh 2.13-22)
[12]Jesus then went into the Temple and drove out all those who were selling and buying there; he upset the tables of the money-changers and the seats of the dove-sellers.
[12]Nuko Yesu yinjira mu rusengero rw'Imana, yirukanamo abaruguriragamo bose, yubika ameza y'abavunjaga ifeza n'intebe z'abaguraga inuma,
[13]He said to them, 'According to scripture, my house will be called a house of prayer; but you are turning it into a bandits' den.'
[13]arababwira ati “Byanditswe ngo ‘Inzu yanjye izitwa inzu yo gusengerwamo’, ariko mwebwe mwayihinduye isenga y'abambuzi.”
[14]There were also blind and lame people who came to him in the Temple, and he cured them.
[14]Nuko impumyi n'ibirema bamusanga mu rusengero arabakiza.
[15]At the sight of the wonderful things he did and of the children shouting, 'Hosanna to the son of David' in the Temple, the chief priests and the scribes were indignant and said to him,
[15]Ariko abatambyi bakuru n'abanditsi babonye ibitangaza akoze, n'abana bavugiye mu rusengero amajwi arenga bati “Hoziyana mwene Dawidi”, bararakara.
[16]'Do you hear what they are saying?' Jesus answered, 'Yes. Have you never read this: By the mouths of children, babes in arms, you have made sure of praise?'
[16]Baramubaza bati “Aho urumva ibyo aba bavuga?”Yesu arabasubiza ati “Yee, ntimwari mwasoma ngo ‘Mu kanwa k'abana bato n'abonka wabonyemo ishimwe ritagira inenge’?”
[17]With that he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.
[17]Arabasiga asohoka mu murwa, ajya i Betaniya ararayo.
[18]As he was returning to the city in the early morning, he felt hungry.
[18]Bukeye bwaho mu gitondo kare asubira mu murwa, arasonza.
[19]Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it and found nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it, 'May you never bear fruit again,' and instantly the fig tree withered.
[19]Abona umutini iruhande rw'inzira arawegera, asanga utariho imbuto keretse ibibabi gusa, arawubwira ati “Ntukere imbuto iteka ryose.” Muri ako kanya uruma.
[20]The disciples were amazed when they saw it and said, 'How is it that the fig tree withered instantly?'
[20]Abigishwa babibonye baratangara bati “Mbega uhereye ko wuma muri ako kanya?”
[21]Jesus answered, 'In truth I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt at all, not only will you do what I have done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, "Be pulled up and thrown into the sea," it will be done.
[21]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko mufite kwizera mudashidikanya, mutakora nk'iby'umutini gusa, ahubwo mwabwira n'uyu musozi muti ‘Shinguka utabwe mu nyanja’, byabaho.
[22]And if you have faith, everything you ask for in prayer, you will receive.'
[22]Kandi ibyo muzasaba mwizeye muzabihabwa byose.”
[23]He had gone into the Temple and was teaching, when the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, 'What authority have you for acting like this? And who gave you this authority?'
[23]Yinjiye mu rusengero, abatambyi bakuru n'abakuru b'ubwo bwoko baza aho ari yigisha, baramubaza bati “Ufite butware ki bugutera gukora ibyo? Ni nde wabuguhaye?”
[24]In reply Jesus said to them, 'And I will ask you a question, just one; if you tell me the answer to it, then I will tell you my authority for acting like this.
[24]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Nanjye reka mbabaze ijambo rimwe, nimurinsubiza nanjye ndababwira ubutware buntera kubikora.
[25]John's baptism: what was its origin, heavenly or human?' And they argued this way among themselves, 'If we say heavenly, he will retort to us, "Then why did you refuse to believe him?";
[25]Kubatiza kwa Yohana kwavuye he, ni mu ijuru cyangwa ni mu bantu?”Nuko biburanya mu mitima yabo bati “Nituvuga yuko kwavuye mu ijuru aratubaza ati ‘Ni iki cyababujije kumwemera?’
[26]but if we say human, we have the people to fear, for they all hold that John was a prophet.'
[26]Nituvuga yuko kwavuye mu bantu, dutinya ko abantu batugaya kuko bose bemera ko Yohana yari umuhanuzi.”
[27]So their reply to Jesus was, 'We do not know.' And he retorted to them, 'Nor will I tell you my authority for acting like this.'
[27]Ni ko gusubiza Yesu bati “Ntitubizi.”Na we arababwira ati “Nuko rero nanjye simbabwira ubutware buntera gukora ibyo.
[28]'What is your opinion? A man had two sons. He went and said to the first, "My boy, go and work in the vineyard today."
[28]“Ariko ibi mubitekereza mute? Habayeho umuntu wari ufite abana babiri, asanga umukuru aramubwira ati ‘Mwana wanjye, genda uhingire uruzabibu rwanjye.’
[29]He answered, "I will not go," but afterwards thought better of it and went.
[29]Na we aramusubiza ati ‘Ndanze.’ Maze hanyuma arihana aragenda.
[30]The man then went and said the same thing to the second who answered, "Certainly, sir," but did not go.
[30]Se asanga uwa kabiri amubwira atyo, na we aramusubiza ati ‘Ndagiye data’, ariko ntiyajyayo.
[31]Which of the two did the father's will?' They said, 'The first.' Jesus said to them, 'In truth I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes are making their way into the kingdom of God before you.
[31]Muri abo bombi ni nde wakoze icyo se ashaka?”Baramusubiza bati “Ni uwa mbere.”Yesu arababwira ati “Ndababwira ukuri yuko abakoresha b'ikoro n'abamaraya bababanziriza kwinjira mu bwami bw'Imana.
[32]For John came to you, showing the way of uprightness, but you did not believe him, and yet the tax collectors and prostitutes did. Even after seeing that, you refused to think better of it and believe in him.
[32]Dore Yohana yaje muri mwe agendera mu nzira yo gukiranuka ntimwamwemera, nyamara abakoresha b'ikoro n'abamaraya bo baramwemeye, ariko nubwo mwabibonye mutyo ntimurakihana ngo mumwemere.
[33]'Listen to another parable. There was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard; he fenced it round, dug a winepress in it and built a tower; then he leased it to tenants and went abroad.
[33]“Mwumve undi mugani: Habayeho umuntu wari ufite urugo, atera uruzabibu azitiraho uruzitiro, acukuramo urwina, yubakamo umunara, asigamo abahinzi ajya mu kindi gihugu.
[34]When vintage time drew near he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his produce.
[34]Nuko igihe cyo gusarura cyenda kugera, atuma abagaragu be ku bahinzi ngo babahe imbuto ze.
[35]But the tenants seized his servants, thrashed one, killed another and stoned a third.
[35]Maze abahinzi bafata abagaragu be, umwe baramukubita undi baramwica, undi bamutera amabuye.
[36]Next he sent some more servants, this time a larger number, and they dealt with them in the same way.
[36]Yongera gutuma abandi bagaragu baruta aba mbere, na bo babagira batyo.
[37]Finally he sent his son to them thinking, "They will respect my son."
[37]Hanyuma abatumaho umwana we ati ‘Bazubaha umwana wanjye.’
[38]But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, "This is the heir. Come on, let us kill him and take over his inheritance."
[38]Maze abahinzi babonye mwene shebuja baravugana bati ‘Uyu ni we mutware, nimucyo tumwice ubutware bube ubwacu.’
[39]So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
[39]Nuko baramufata bamwirukana mu ruzabibu, baramwica.
[40]Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?'
[40]“Mbese nyir'uruzabibu naza, abo bahinzi azabagenza ate?”
[41]They answered, 'He will bring those wretches to a wretched end and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will deliver the produce to him at the proper time.'
[41]Baramusubiza bati “Abo bagome azabarimbura bibi, maze uruzabibu arusigemo abandi bahinzi bazajya bamuha imbuto za rwo igihe cya zo.”
[42]Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this is the Lord's doing and we marvel at it?
[42]Yesu arababaza ati “Ntimwari mwasoma mu byanditswe ngo‘Ibuye abubatsi banze,Ni ryo ryahindutse irikomeza imfuruka!Ibyo byavuye ku Uwiteka,Kandi ni ibitangaza mu maso yacu.’
[43]'I tell you, then, that the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.'
[43]“Ni cyo gitumye mbabwira yuko ubwami bw'Imana muzabunyagwa, bugahabwa ishyanga ryera imbuto zabwo. [
[44]
[44]Kandi uzagwira iryo buye azavunagurika, ariko uwo rizagwira wese, rizamumenagura rimugire ifu.]”
[45]When they heard his parables, the chief priests and the scribes realised he was speaking about them,
[45]Abatambyi bakuru n'Abafarisayo bumvise imigani ye bamenya yuko ari bo avuga.
[46]but though they would have liked to arrest him they were afraid of the crowds, who looked on him as a prophet.
[46]Bashaka kumufata ariko batinya rubanda, kuko bemeraga ko ari umuhanuzi.

Matthew 22:1-46
Mt 22:1-46
[1]Jesus began to speak to them in parables once again,
[1]Yesu yongera kuvugana na bo abacira imigani ati
[2]'The kingdom of Heaven may be compared to a king who gave a feast for his son's wedding.
[2]“Ubwami bwo mu ijuru bugereranywa n'umwami wacyujije ubukwe bw'umwana we arongora,
[3]He sent his servants to call those who had been invited, but they would not come.
[3]atuma abagaragu be guhamagara abatorewe gutaha ubukwe, banga kuza.
[4]Next he sent some more servants with the words, "Tell those who have been invited: Look, my banquet is all prepared, my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, everything is ready. Come to the wedding."
[4]Arongera atuma abandi bagaragu ati ‘Mubwire abatowe muti: Dore niteguye amazimano, amapfizi yanjye n'inka zibyibushye babibāze, byose byiteguwe, muze mu bukwe.’
[5]But they were not interested: one went off to his farm, another to his business,
[5]“Maze abo ntibabyitaho barigendera, umwe ajya mu gikingi cye, undi ajya mu rutundo rwe,
[6]and the rest seized his servants, maltreated them and killed them.
[6]abasigaye bafata abagaragu be barabashinyagurira, barabica.
[7]The king was furious. He despatched his troops, destroyed those murderers and burnt their town.
[7]Maze umwami ararakara agaba ingabo ze, arimbura abo bicanyi atwika umudugudu wabo.
[8]Then he said to his servants, "The wedding is ready; but as those who were invited proved to be unworthy,
[8]Maze abwira abagaragu be ati ‘Ubukwe bwiteguwe, ariko abari babutorewe ntibari babukwiriye.
[9]go to the main crossroads and invite everyone you can find to come to the wedding."
[9]Nuko mujye mu nzira nyabagendwa, abo muri buboneyo bose mubahamagare baze batahe ubukwe.’
[10]So these servants went out onto the roads and collected together everyone they could find, bad and good alike; and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
[10]Abo bagaragu barasohoka bajya mu nzira, bateranya abo babonye bose, ababi n'abeza, inzu yo gucyurizamo ubukwe yuzura abasangwa.
[11]When the king came in to look at the guests he noticed one man who was not wearing a wedding garment,
[11]“Umwami yinjiye kureba abasangwa, abonamo umuntu utambaye umwenda w'ubukwe.
[12]and said to him, "How did you get in here, my friend, without a wedding garment?" And the man was silent.
[12]Aramubaza ati ‘Mugenzi wanjye, ni iki gitumye winjira hano utambaye umwenda w'ubukwe?’ Na we arahora rwose.
[13]Then the king said to the attendants, "Bind him hand and foot and throw him into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."
[13]Maze umwami abwira abagaragu be ati ‘Nimumubohe amaboko n'amaguru, mumujugunye mu mwijima hanze, ni ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo’,
[14]For many are invited but not all are chosen.'
[14]kuko abatowe ari benshi, ariko abatoranyijwe bakaba bake.”
[15]Then the Pharisees went away to work out between them how to trap him in what he said.
[15]Maze Abafarisayo baragenda bajya inama y'uko bari bumutegeshe amagambo.
[16]And they sent their disciples to him, together with some Herodians, to say, 'Master, we know that you are an honest man and teach the way of God in all honesty, and that you are not afraid of anyone, because human rank means nothing to you.
[16]Bamutumaho abigishwa babo hamwe n'Abaherode bati “Mwigisha, tuzi yuko uri inyangamugayo kandi ko wigisha inzira y'Imana by'ukuri, nturobanura abantu ku butoni, kuko utita ku cyubahiro cy'umuntu wese.
[17]Give us your opinion, then. Is it permissible to pay taxes to Caesar or not?'
[17]Nuko tubwire, utekereza ute? Amategeko yemera ko duha Kayisari umusoro, cyangwa ntiyemera?”
[18]But Jesus was aware of their malice and replied, 'You hypocrites! Why are you putting me to the test?
[18]Ariko Yesu amenya uburiganya bwabo, arababaza ati “Mungeragereje iki, mwa ndyarya mwe?
[19]Show me the money you pay the tax with.' They handed him a denarius,
[19]Nimunyereke ifeza y'umusoro.”Bamuzanira idenariyo.
[20]and he said, 'Whose portrait is this? Whose title?'
[20]Arababaza ati “Iyi shusho n'iri zina ni ibya nde?”
[21]They replied, 'Caesar's.' Then he said to them, 'Very well, pay Caesar what belongs to Caesar -- and God what belongs to God.'
[21]Baramusubiza bati “Ni ibya Kayisari.”Maze arababwira ati “Nuko rero ibya Kayisari mubihe Kayisari, iby'Imana mubihe Imana.”
[22]When they heard this they were amazed; they left him alone and went away.
[22]Babyumvise barumirwa, bamusiga aho baragenda.
[23]That day some Sadducees -- who deny that there is a resurrection -- approached him and they put this question to him,
[23]Uwo munsi Abasadukayo bahakanaga yuko ari nta wuzuka, baza aho ari baramubaza bati
[24]'Master, Moses said that if a man dies childless, his brother is to marry the widow, his sister-in-law, to raise children for his brother.
[24]“Mwigisha, Mose yaravuze ngo umuntu napfa batarabyarana, mwene se nahungure umugore we acikure mwene se.
[25]Now we had a case involving seven brothers; the first married and then died without children, leaving his wife to his brother;
[25]Nuko iwacu habayeho abavandimwe barindwi, uwa mbere yararongoye arapfa, maze kuko batabyaranye araga mwene se umugore we.
[26]the same thing happened with the second and third and so on to the seventh,
[26]Nuko n'uwa kabiri n'uwa gatatu kugeza kuri bose uko ari barindwi bamera batyo.
[27]and then last of all the woman herself died.
[27]Hanyuma wa mugore na we arapfa.
[28]Now at the resurrection, whose wife among the seven will she be, since she had been married to them all?'
[28]Mbese mu izuka, azaba ari muka nde muri bose uko ari barindwi, ko bose bari bamufite?”
[29]Jesus answered them, 'You are wrong, because you understand neither the scriptures nor the power of God.
[29]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Mwarahabye kuko mutamenye ibyanditswe cyangwa imbaraga z'Imana.
[30]For at the resurrection men and women do not marry; no, they are like the angels in heaven.
[30]Mu izuka ntibarongora kandi ntibashyingirwa, ahubwo bamera nk'abamarayika bo mu ijuru.
[31]And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you never read what God himself said to you:
[31]Ariko se ibyerekeye ku kuzuka kw'abapfuye, ntimwari mwasoma icyo Imana yababwiye ngo
[32]I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? He is God, not of the dead, but of the living.'
[32]‘Ni jye Mana ya Aburahamu n'Imana ya Isaka n'Imana ya Yakobo?’ Imana si Imana y'abapfuye, ahubwo ni iy'abazima.”
[33]And his teaching made a deep impression on the people who heard it.
[33]Abantu babyumvise batangazwa no kwigisha kwe.
[34]But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees they got together
[34]Ariko Abafarisayo bumvise yuko yatsinze Abasadukayo, bakananirwa kumusubiza, bateranira hamwe,
[35]and, to put him to the test, one of them put a further question,
[35]umwe muri bo w'umwigishamategeko amubaza amugerageza ati
[36]'Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?'
[36]“Mwigisha, itegeko rikomeye mu mategeko ni irihe?”
[37]Jesus said to him, 'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
[37]Na we aramusubiza ati “ ‘Ukundishe Uwiteka, Imana yawe umutima wawe wose n'ubugingo bwawe bwose n'ubwenge bwawe bwose.’
[38]This is the greatest and the first commandment.
[38]Iryo ni ryo tegeko rikomeye ry'imbere.
[39]The second resembles it: You must love your neighbour as yourself.
[39]N'irya kabiri rihwanye na ryo ngiri ‘Ukunde mugenzi wawe nk'uko wikunda.’
[40]On these two commandments hang the whole Law, and the Prophets too.'
[40]Muri ayo mategeko yombi, amategeko yose n'ibyahanuwe ni yo yuririraho.”
[41]While the Pharisees were gathered round, Jesus put to them this question,
[41]Abafarisayo bagiteranye, Yesu arababaza ati
[42]'What is your opinion about the Christ? Whose son is he?' They told him, 'David's.'
[42]“Ibya Kristo murabitekereza mute? Ni mwene nde?”Baramusubiza bati “Ni mwene Dawidi.”
[43]He said to them, 'Then how is it that David, moved by the Spirit, calls him Lord, where he says:
[43]Arababaza ati “Nuko rero ni iki cyatumye Dawidi yabwirijwe n'Umwuka amwita umwami we ati
[44]The Lord declared to my Lord, take your seat at my right hand, till I have made your enemies your footstool?
[44]‘Uwiteka yabwiye Umwami wanjye ati:Icara iburyo bwanjye,Ugeze aho nzashyirira abanzi bawe munsi y'ibirenge byawe.’
[45]'If David calls him Lord, how then can he be his son?'
[45]Nuko ubwo Dawidi amwita umwami we, none abasha ate no kuba umwana we?”
[46]No one could think of anything to say in reply, and from that day no one dared to ask him any further questions.
[46]Ntihagira umuntu wabasha kumusubiza ijambo, ndetse uhereye uwo munsi nta muntu watinyutse kongera kugira icyo amubaza.

Matthew 23:1-39
Mt 23:1-39
[1]Then addressing the crowds and his disciples Jesus said,
[1]Maze Yesu avugana n'iteraniro ry'abantu n'abigishwa be ati
[2]'The scribes and the Pharisees occupy the chair of Moses.
[2]“Abanditsi n'Abafarisayo bicaye ku ntebe ya Mose.
[3]You must therefore do and observe what they tell you; but do not be guided by what they do, since they do not practise what they preach.
[3]Nuko rero ibyo bababwira byose mubikore mubiziririze, ariko imigenzo yabo mwe kuyikurikiza kuko ibyo bavuga atari byo bakora.
[4]They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on people's shoulders, but will they lift a finger to move them? Not they!
[4]Bahambira imitwaro iremereye idaterurwa bakayihekesha abantu ku ntugu, ariko ubwabo ntibemere kuba bayikozaho n'urutoki rwabo.
[5]Everything they do is done to attract attention, like wearing broader headbands and longer tassels,
[5]Ahubwo imirimo yabo yose bayikorera kugira ngo abantu babarebe: n'impapuro bambara zanditsweho amagambo y'Imana bazāgura, bakongēra inshunda z'imyenda yabo,
[6]like wanting to take the place of honour at banquets and the front seats in the synagogues,
[6]kandi bakunda imyanya y'abakuru mu birori, n'intebe z'icyubahiro mu masinagogi,
[7]being greeted respectfully in the market squares and having people call them Rabbi.
[7]no kuramukirizwa mu maguriro, no kwitwa n'abantu Rabi.
[8]'You, however, must not allow yourselves to be called Rabbi, since you have only one Master, and you are all brothers.
[8]Ariko mwebweho ntimuzitwe Rabi, kuko umwigisha wanyu ari umwe, namwe mwese muri abavandimwe.
[9]You must call no one on earth your father, since you have only one Father, and he is in heaven.
[9]Kandi ntimukagire umuntu wo mu isi mwita Data, kuko So ari umwe, ari uwo mu ijuru.
[10]Nor must you allow yourselves to be called teachers, for you have only one Teacher, the Christ.
[10]Kandi ntimuzitwe abakuru, kuko umukuru wanyu ari umwe, ari Kristo.
[11]The greatest among you must be your servant.
[11]Ahubwo uruta abandi muri mwe ajye aba umugaragu wanyu.
[12]Anyone who raises himself up will be humbled, and anyone who humbles himself will be raised up.
[12]Uzishyira hejuru azacishwa bugufi, uzicisha bugufi azashyirwa hejuru.
[13]'Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut up the kingdom of Heaven in people's faces, neither going in yourselves nor allowing others to go who want to.
[13]“Ariko mwebwe banditsi n'Abafarisayo, mwa ndyarya mwe, muzabona ishyano kuko mwugarira ubwami bwo mu ijuru ngo abantu batabwinjiramo, namwe ubwanyu ntimwinjiremo kandi n'abashaka kwinjiramo ntimubakundire. [
[14]
[14]Mwebwe banditsi n'Abafarisayo, mwa ndyarya mwe, muzabona ishyano kuko murya ingo z'abapfakazi, kandi mugakomeza kuvuga amasengesho y'urudaca muryarya. Ni cyo gituma muzacirwa ho iteka riruta ayandi.]
[15]'Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over sea and land to make a single proselyte, and anyone who becomes one you make twice as fit for hell as you are.
[15]“Mwebwe banditsi n'Abafarisayo, mwa ndyarya mwe, muzabona ishyano kuko muzererezwa mu nyanja no mu misozi no guhindura umuntu umwe ngo yemere idini yanyu, ariko iyo ahindutse, mutuma abaruta inkubwe ebyiri kuba umwana w'i Gehinomu.
[16]'Alas for you, blind guides! You say, "If anyone swears by the Temple, it has no force; but anyone who swears by the gold of the Temple is bound."
[16]“Mwa barandasi bahumye mwe, muzabona ishyano mwebwe abavuga muti ‘Urahiye urusengero nta cyo bitwaye’, ariko ngo ‘Urahiye izahabu yo mu rusengero azaba yibohesheje iyo ndahiro arahiye.’
[17]Fools and blind! For which is of greater value, the gold or the Temple that makes the gold sacred?
[17]Mwa bapfu mwe, mwa mpumyi mwe, ikiruta ikindi ni ikihe, ni izahabu cyangwa ni urusengero rwubahiriza izahabu?
[18]Again, "If anyone swears by the altar it has no force; but anyone who swears by the offering on the altar, is bound."
[18]Kandi ngo ‘Urahiye igicaniro nta cyo bitwaye, ariko urahira ituro rikiriho azaba yibohesheje iyo ndahiro arahiye.’
[19]You blind men! For which is of greater worth, the offering or the altar that makes the offering sacred?
[19]Mwa mpumyi mwe, ikiruta ikindi ni ikihe, ni ituro cyangwa ni igicaniro cyubahiriza ituro?
[20]Therefore, someone who swears by the altar is swearing by that and by everything on it.
[20]Nuko urahiye igicaniro ni cyo aba arahiye n'ibikiriho byose,
[21]And someone who swears by the Temple is swearing by that and by the One who dwells in it.
[21]kandi urahiye urusengero ni rwo aba arahiye n'Irubamo.
[22]And someone who swears by heaven is swearing by the throne of God and by the One who is seated there.
[22]Kandi ūrahiye ijuru, aba arahiye intebe y'Imana n'Iyicaraho.
[23]'Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You pay your tithe of mint and dill and cummin and have neglected the weightier matters of the Law-justice, mercy, good faith! These you should have practised, those not neglected.
[23]“Mwebwe banditsi n'Abafarisayo, mwa ndyarya mwe, muzabona ishyano kuko mutanga kimwe mu icumi cy'isogi na anisi na kumino, mukirengagiza amagambo akomeye yo mu mategeko, ari yo kutabera n'imbabazi no kwizera. Ibyo mwari mukwiriye kubikora, na bya bindi ntimubireke.
[24]You blind guides, straining out gnats and swallowing camels!
[24]Mwa barandasi bahumye mwe, mumimina umubu ariko ingamiya mukayimira bunguri.
[25]'Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of cup and dish and leave the inside full of extortion and intemperance.
[25]“Mwebwe banditsi n'Abafarisayo, mwa ndyarya mwe, muzabona ishyano kuko mwoza inyuma y'igikombe n'imbehe, ariko imbere yabyo huzuye ubwambuzi bwanyu no kutirinda.
[26]Blind Pharisee! Clean the inside of cup and dish first so that it and the outside are both clean.
[26]Wa Mufarisayo uhumye we, banza woze imbere y'igikombe n'imbehe, inyuma yabyo habone kuba heza.
[27]'Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs that look handsome on the outside, but inside are full of the bones of the dead and every kind of corruption.
[27]“Mwebwe banditsi n'Abafarisayo, mwa ndyarya mwe, muzabona ishyano kuko mumeze nk'ibituro byasizwe ingwa, bigaragara inyuma ari byiza, nyamara imbere byuzuye amagufwa y'abapfuye n'ibihumanya byose.
[28]In just the same way, from the outside you look upright, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
[28]Ni ko muri namwe, inyuma mugaragarira abantu muri abakiranutsi, ariko mu mutima mwuzuye uburyarya n'ubugome.
[29]'Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build the sepulchres of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the upright,
[29]“Mwebwe banditsi n'Abafarisayo, mwa ndyarya mwe, muzabona ishyano kuko mwubaka ibituro by'abahanuzi, mukarimbisha inzibutso z'abakiranutsi,
[30]saying, "We would never have joined in shedding the blood of the prophets, had we lived in our ancestors' day."
[30]mukavuga muti ‘Iyaba twariho mu gihe cya ba sogokuruza, ntituba twarafatanije na bo kuvusha amaraso y'abahanuzi.’
[31]So! Your own evidence tells against you! You are the children of those who murdered the prophets!
[31]Uko ni ko mwihamya, yuko muri abana b'abishe abahanuzi.
[32]Very well then, finish off the work that your ancestors began.
[32]Ngaho, nimwuzuze urugero rwa ba sekuruza wanyu.
[33]'You serpents, brood of vipers, how can you escape being condemned to hell?
[33]Mwa nzoka mwe, mwa bana b'incira mwe, muzahunga mute iteka ry'i Gehinomu?
[34]This is why -- look -- I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some you will slaughter and crucify, some you will scourge in your synagogues and hunt from town to town;
[34]Nuko rero ku bw'ibyo, ngiye kubatumaho abahanuzi n'abanyabwenge n'abanditsi: bamwe muri bo muzabica muzababamba, abandi muzabakubitira mu masinagogi yanyu, muzabirukana mu midugudu yose bajyamo,
[35]and so you will draw down on yourselves the blood of every upright person that has been shed on earth, from the blood of Abel the holy to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
[35]muhereko mugibweho n'amaraso yose y'abakiranutsi yaviriye ku isi, uhereye ku maraso ya Abeli umukiranutsi, ukageza ku maraso ya Zakariya mwene Berekiya, mwiciye hagati y'Ahera h'urusengero n'igicaniro.
[36]In truth I tell you, it will all recoil on this generation.
[36]Ndababwira ukuri yuko ibyo byose bizasohora ku b'iki gihe.
[37]'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often have I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you refused!
[37]“Yerusalemu, Yerusalemu, wica abahanuzi ugatera amabuye abagutumweho, ni kangahe nshaka kubundikira abana bawe, nk'uko inkoko ibundikira imishwi yayo mu mababa yayo ntimunkundire?
[38]Look! Your house will be deserted,
[38]Dore inzu yanyu muyisigiwe ari umusaka.
[39]for, I promise, you shall not see me any more until you are saying: Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord!'
[39]Ndababwira yuko mutazambona uhereye none ukageza ubwo muzavuga muti ‘Hahirwa uje mu izina ry'Uwiteka.’ ”

Matthew 24:1-51
Mt 24:1-51
[1]Jesus left the Temple, and as he was going away his disciples came up to draw his attention to the Temple buildings.
[1]Yesu asohoka mu rusengero. Akigenda, abigishwa be baramusanga bashaka kumwereka imyubakire y'urusengero.
[2]He said to them in reply, 'You see all these? In truth I tell you, not a single stone here will be left on another: everything will be pulled down.'
[2]Arababwira ati “Ntimureba ibi byose? Ndababwira ukuri yuko aha hatazasigara ibuye rigeretse ku rindi ritajugunywe hasi.”
[3]And while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives the disciples came and asked him when they were by themselves, 'Tell us, when is this going to happen, and what sign will there be of your coming and of the end of the world?'
[3]Yicaye ku musozi wa Elayono, abigishwa baza aho ari biherereye baramubaza bati “Tubwire, ibyo bizaba ryari, n'ikimenyetso cyo kuza kwawe n'icy'imperuka y'isi ni ikihe?”
[4]And Jesus answered them, 'Take care that no one deceives you,
[4]Yesu arabasubiza ati “Mwirinde hatagira umuntu ubayobya,
[5]because many will come using my name and saying, "I am the Christ," and they will deceive many.
[5]kuko benshi bazaza biyita izina ryanjye bati ‘Ni jye Kristo’, bazayobya benshi.
[6]You will hear of wars and rumours of wars; see that you are not alarmed, for this is something that must happen, but the end will not be yet.
[6]Muzumva iby'intambara n'impuha z'intambara, mwirinde mudahagarika imitima kuko bitazabura kubaho, ariko imperuka izaba itaraza.
[7]For nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
[7]Ishyanga rizatera irindi shyanga, n'ubwami buzatera ubundi bwami, hazabaho inzara n'ibishyitsi hamwe na hamwe.
[8]All this is only the beginning of the birthpangs.
[8]Ariko ibyo byose bizaba ari itangiriro ryo kuramukwa.
[9]'Then you will be handed over to be tortured and put to death; and you will be hated by all nations on account of my name.
[9]“Ubwo ni bwo bazabagambanira ngo mubabazwe, ndetse bazabica, muzangwa n'amahanga yose abahora izina ryanjye.
[10]And then many will fall away; people will betray one another and hate one another.
[10]Ni bwo benshi bazasubira inyuma, bazagambanirana bangane.
[11]Many false prophets will arise; they will deceive many,
[11]N'abahanuzi benshi b'ibinyoma bazaduka bayobye benshi.
[12]and with the increase of lawlessness, love in most people will grow cold;
[12]Maze kuko ubugome buzagwira, urukundo rwa benshi ruzakonja.
[13]but anyone who stands firm to the end will be saved.
[13]Ariko uwihangana akageza imperuka ni we uzakizwa.
[14]'This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed to the whole world as evidence to the nations. And then the end will come.
[14]Kandi ubu butumwa bwiza bw'ubwami buzigishwa mu isi yose, ngo bube ubuhamya bwo guhamiriza amahanga yose, ni bwo imperuka izaherako ize.
[15]'So when you see the appalling abomination, of which the prophet Daniel spoke, set up in the holy place (let the reader understand),
[15]“Ariko ubwo muzabona ikizira kirimbura cyahanuwe n'umuhanuzi Daniyeli gihagaze Ahera, (ubisoma abyitondere),
[16]then those in Judaea must escape to the mountains;
[16]icyo gihe abazaba bari i Yudaya bazahungire ku misozi,
[17]if anyone is on the housetop, he must not come down to collect his belongings from the house;
[17]n'uzaba ari hejuru y'inzu ye ntazamanuka ngo atware ku bintu byo mu nzu ye,
[18]if anyone is in the fields, he must not turn back to fetch his cloak.
[18]n'uzaba ari mu mirima ye ntazasubira imuhira ngo azane umwenda we.
[19]Alas for those with child, or with babies at the breast, when those days come!
[19]Abazaba batwite n'abonsa muri iyo minsi bazabona ishyano.
[20]Pray that you will not have to make your escape in winter or on a Sabbath.
[20]Namwe musengere kugira ngo guhunga kwanyu kutazabaho mu mezi y'imbeho cyangwa ku isabato,
[21]For then there will be great distress, unparalleled since the world began, and such as will never be again.
[21]kuko muri iyo minsi hazabaho umubabaro mwinshi, utigeze kubaho uhereye ku kuremwa ku isi ukageza none, kandi ntuzongera kubaho.
[22]And if that time had not been shortened, no human being would have survived; but shortened that time shall be, for the sake of those who are chosen.
[22]Iyo minsi iyaba itagabanijweho ntihajyaga kuzarokoka n'umwe, ariko ku bw'intore iyo minsi izagabanywaho.
[23]'If anyone says to you then, "Look, here is the Christ," or "Over here," do not believe it;
[23]“Icyo gihe umuntu nababwira ati ‘Dore Kristo ari hano’, n'undi ati ‘Ari hano’, ntimuzabyemere.
[24]for false Christs and false prophets will arise and provide great signs and portents, enough to deceive even the elect, if that were possible.
[24]Kuko abiyita Kristo n'abahanuzi b'ibinyoma bazaduka bakora ibimenyetso bikomeye n'ibitangaza, kugira ngo babone uko bayobya n'intore niba bishoboka.
[25]Look! I have given you warning.
[25]Dore mbibabwiye bitaraba.
[26]'If, then, they say to you, "Look, he is in the desert," do not go there; "Look, he is in some hiding place," do not believe it;
[26]“Nuko nibababwira bati ‘Dore ari mu butayu’, ntimuzajyeyo, cyangwa bati ‘Dore ari mu kirambi’, ntimuzabyemere.
[27]because the coming of the Son of man will be like lightning striking in the east and flashing far into the west.
[27]Kuko nk'uko umurabyo urabiriza iburasirazuba ukabonekera aho rirengera, ni ko no kuza k'Umwana w'umuntu kuzaba.
[28]Wherever the corpse is, that is where the vultures will gather.
[28]“Aho intumbi iri hose, ni ho inkongoro ziteranira.
[29]'Immediately after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
[29]“Ariko hanyuma y'umubabaro wo muri iyo minsi, uwo mwanya ‘Izuba rizijima, n'ukwezi ntikuzava umwezi wako, n'inyenyeri zizagwa ziva mu ijuru, n'imbaraga zo mu ijuru zizanyeganyega.’
[30]And then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven; then, too, all the peoples of the earth will beat their breasts; and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
[30]Ubwo ni bwo ikimenyetso cy'Umwana w'umuntu kizabonekera mu ijuru, n'amoko yose yo mu isi ni bwo azaboroga abonye Umwana w'umuntu aje ku bicu byo mu ijuru, afite ubushobozi n'ubwiza bwinshi.
[31]And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet to gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
[31]Azatumisha abamarayika be ijwi rirenga ry'impanda, bateranye intore ze mu birere bine, uhereye impera y'ijuru ukageza iyindi mpera yaryo.
[32]'Take the fig tree as a parable: as soon as its twigs grow supple and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
[32]“Murebere ku mutini ni wo cyitegererezo: ishami ryawo, iyo ritoshye ibibabi bikamera, mumenya yuko igihe cy'impeshyi kiri bugufi.
[33]So with you when you see all these things: know that he is near, right at the gates.
[33]Nuko namwe nimubona ibyo byose, muzamenye yuko ari hafi, ndetse ageze ku rugi.
[34]In truth I tell you, before this generation has passed away, all these things will have taken place.
[34]Ndababwira ukuri yuko ab'ubu bwoko batazashiraho kugeza aho ibyo byose bizasohorera.
[35]Sky and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
[35]Ijuru n'isi bizashira, ariko amagambo yanjye ntazashira na hato.
[36]But as for that day and hour, nobody knows it, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, no one but the Father alone.
[36]“Ariko uwo munsi n'icyo gihe nta wubizi, naho baba abamarayika bo mu ijuru cyangwa Umwana, keretse Data wenyine.
[37]'As it was in Noah's day, so will it be when the Son of man comes.
[37]Uko iminsi ya Nowa yari iri, no kuza k'Umwana w'umuntu ni ko kuzaba,
[38]For in those days before the Flood people were eating, drinking, taking wives, taking husbands, right up to the day Noah went into the ark,
[38]kuko nk'uko bari bameze muri iyo minsi yabanjirije umwuzure, bararyaga, baranywaga, bararongoraga, barashyingiraga, bageza umunsi Nowa yinjiriye mu nkuge,
[39]and they suspected nothing till the Flood came and swept them all away. This is what it will be like when the Son of man comes.
[39]ntibabimenya kugeza aho umwuzure waziye ukabatwara bose. Ni ko no kuza k'Umwana w'umuntu kuzaba.
[40]Then of two men in the fields, one is taken, one left;
[40]Icyo gihe abagabo babiri bazaba bari mu murima, umwe azajyanwa undi asigare,
[41]of two women grinding at the mill, one is taken, one left.
[41]abagore babiri bazaba basya ku rusyo, umwe azajyanwa undi asigare.
[42]'So stay awake, because you do not know the day when your master is coming.
[42]“Nuko mube maso kuko mutazi umunsi Umwami wanyu azazaho.
[43]You may be quite sure of this, that if the householder had known at what time of the night the burglar would come, he would have stayed awake and would not have allowed anyone to break through the wall of his house.
[43]Ariko ibi mubimenye, iyaba nyir'urugo yari amenye igicuku umujura azaziramo yabaye maso, ntiyamukundiye gucukura inzu ye.
[44]Therefore, you too must stand ready because the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
[44]Nuko namwe mwitegure, kuko igihe mudatekereza ari cyo Umwana w'umuntu azaziramo.
[45]'Who, then, is the wise and trustworthy servant whom the master placed over his household to give them their food at the proper time?
[45]“Mbese ni nde mugaragu ukiranuka w'ubwenge, shebuja yasigiye abo mu rugo rwe kubagerera igerero igihe cyaryo?
[46]Blessed that servant if his master's arrival finds him doing exactly that.
[46]Uwo mugaragu arahirwa, shebuja naza agasanga abikora.
[47]In truth I tell you, he will put him in charge of everything he owns.
[47]Ndababwira ukuri yuko azamwegurira ibintu bye byose.
[48]But if the servant is dishonest and says to himself, "My master is taking his time,"
[48]Ariko umugaragu mubi niyibwira mu mutima we ati ‘Databuja aratinze’,
[49]and sets about beating his fellow-servants and eating and drinking with drunkards,
[49]maze agatangira gukubita abagaragu bagenzi be no gusangira n'abasinzi,
[50]his master will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know.
[50]shebuja w'uwo mugaragu azaza umunsi atamutegereje n'igihe atazi,
[51]The master will cut him off and send him to the same fate as the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.'
[51]amucemo kabiri amuhanane n'indyarya. Ni ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo.

Matthew 25:1-46
Mt 25:1-46
[1]'Then the kingdom of Heaven will be like this: Ten wedding attendants took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
[1]“Icyo gihe ubwami bwo mu ijuru buzagereranywa n'abakobwa cumi bajyanye amatabaza yabo, bajya gusanganira umukwe.
[2]Five of them were foolish and five were sensible:
[2]Ariko muri abo cumi, abatanu bari abapfu, abandi batanu bari abanyabwenge.
[3]the foolish ones, though they took their lamps, took no oil with them,
[3]Abapfu bajyanye amatabaza yabo ntibajyana n'amavuta,
[4]whereas the sensible ones took flasks of oil as well as their lamps.
[4]ariko abanyabwenge bo bajyana amavuta mu mperezo zabo hamwe n'amatabaza yabo.
[5]The bridegroom was late, and they all grew drowsy and fell asleep.
[5]Umukwe atinze bose barahunikira, barasinzira.
[6]But at midnight there was a cry, "Look! The bridegroom! Go out and meet him."
[6]“Ariko nijoro mu gicuku habaho urusaku ngo ‘Umukwe araje, nimusohoke mumusanganire!’
[7]Then all those wedding attendants woke up and trimmed their lamps,
[7]Maze ba bakobwa bose barahaguruka baboneza amatabaza yabo.
[8]and the foolish ones said to the sensible ones, "Give us some of your oil: our lamps are going out."
[8]Abapfu babwira abanyabwenge bati ‘Nimuduhe ku mavuta yanyu, kuko amatabaza yacu azima.’
[9]But they replied, "There may not be enough for us and for you; you had better go to those who sell it and buy some for yourselves."
[9]Ariko abanyabwenge barabahakanira bati ‘Oya, ntiyadukwira twese, ahubwo nimujye mu bahanjuzi muyigurire.’
[10]They had gone off to buy it when the bridegroom arrived. Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding hall and the door was closed.
[10]Bagiye kugura, umukwe araza, abari biteguye binjirana na we mu bukwe, urugi rurakingwa.
[11]The other attendants arrived later. "Lord, Lord," they said, "open the door for us."
[11]“Hanyuma ba bakobwa bandi na bo baraza, barahamagara bati ‘Nyakubahwa, dukingurire.’
[12]But he replied, "In truth I tell you, I do not know you."
[12]Na we arabasubiza ati ‘Ndababwira ukuri yuko ntabazi.’
[13]So stay awake, because you do not know either the day or the hour.
[13]“Nuko mube maso, kuko mutazi umunsi cyangwa igihe.
[14]'It is like a man about to go abroad who summoned his servants and entrusted his property to them.
[14]“Bizaba nk'iby'umuntu wari ugiye kuzindukira mu kindi gihugu, ahamagara abagaragu be abasigira ibintu bye,
[15]To one he gave five talents, to another two, to a third one, each in proportion to his ability. Then he set out on his journey.
[15]aha umwe italanto eshanu, undi amuha ebyiri, undi amuha imwe uko umuntu ashoboye, arazinduka.
[16]The man who had received the five talents promptly went and traded with them and made five more.
[16]Uwo mwanya uwahawe italanto eshanu aragenda arazigenza, agenzuramo izindi talanto eshanu.
[17]The man who had received two made two more in the same way.
[17]N'uwahawe ebyiri abigenza atyo, agenzuramo izindi ebyiri.
[18]But the man who had received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.
[18]Ariko uwahawe imwe aragenda acukura umwobo, ahishamo italanto ya shebuja.
[19]Now a long time afterwards, the master of those servants came back and went through his accounts with them.
[19]“Maze iminsi myinshi ishize, shebuja w'abo bagaragu araza, abarana na bo umubare w'ibyo yabasigiye.
[20]The man who had received the five talents came forward bringing five more. "Sir," he said, "you entrusted me with five talents; here are five more that I have made."
[20]Uwahawe italanto eshanu araza, azana izindi talanto eshanu ati ‘Databuja, wansigiye italanto eshanu, dore nazigenzuyemo izindi talanto eshanu.’
[21]His master said to him, "Well done, good and trustworthy servant; you have shown you are trustworthy in small things; I will trust you with greater; come and join in your master's happiness."
[21]Shebuja aramubwira ati ‘Nuko nuko mugaragu mwiza ukiranuka, wakiranutse mu bike, nzakwegurira byinshi, injira mu munezero wa shobuja.’
[22]Next the man with the two talents came forward. "Sir," he said, "you entrusted me with two talents; here are two more that I have made."
[22]“N'uwahawe italanto ebyiri araza aravuga ati ‘Databuja, wansigiye italanto ebyiri, dore nazigenzuyemo izindi ebyiri.’
[23]His master said to him, "Well done, good and trustworthy servant; you have shown you are trustworthy in small things; I will trust you with greater; come and join in your master's happiness."
[23]Shebuja aramubwira ati ‘Nuko nuko mugaragu mwiza ukiranuka, wakiranutse mu bike, nzakwegurira byinshi, injira mu munezero wa shobuja.’
[24]Last came forward the man who had the single talent. "Sir," said he, "I had heard you were a hard man, reaping where you had not sown and gathering where you had not scattered;
[24]“N'uwahawe imwe araza aravuga ati ‘Databuja, nari nzi ko uri umunyamwaga, ko usarura aho utabibye, ko uhunika ibyo utagosoye
[25]so I was afraid, and I went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here it is; it was yours, you have it back."
[25]ndatinya, ndagenda mpisha italanto yawe mu butaka. dore ngiyo, ibyawe urabifite.’
[26]But his master answered him, "You wicked and lazy servant! So you knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered?
[26]“Ariko shebuja aramusubiza ati ‘Wa mugaragu mubi we, wa munyabute we, ko wari uzi ko nsarura aho ntabibye, mpunika ibyo ntagosoye,
[27]Well then, you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have got my money back with interest.
[27]italanto yawe ntiwari ukwiriye kuyiha abagenza, nanjye naza ukampana iyanjye n'inyungu yayo?
[28]So now, take the talent from him and give it to the man who has the ten talents.
[28]Nuko nimuyimwake, muyihe ufite italanto cumi.
[29]For to everyone who has will be given more, and he will have more than enough; but anyone who has not, will be deprived even of what he has.
[29]Kuko ufite wese azahabwa akarushirizwaho, ariko udafite azakwa n'icyo yari afite.
[30]As for this good-for-nothing servant, throw him into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth."
[30]N'uyu mugaragu nta cyo amaze, mumujugunye mu mwijima hanze. Ni ho bazaririra bakahahekenyera amenyo.’
[31]'When the Son of man comes in his glory, escorted by all the angels, then he will take his seat on his throne of glory.
[31]“Umwana w'umuntu ubwo azazana n'abamarayika bose afite ubwiza bwe, ni bwo azicara ku ntebe y'ubwiza bwe.
[32]All nations will be assembled before him and he will separate people one from another as the shepherd separates sheep from goats.
[32]Amahanga yose azateranirizwa imbere ye, abarobanure nk'uko umwungeri arobanura intama mu ihene,
[33]He will place the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
[33]intama azazishyira iburyo bwe, naho ihene azishyire ibumoso.
[34]Then the King will say to those on his right hand, "Come, you whom my Father has blessed, take as your heritage the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world.
[34]Umwami azabwira abari iburyo bwe ati ‘Nimuze mwebwe abo Data yahaye umugisha, muragwe ubwami bwabatunganirijwe uhereye ku kuremwa kw'isi,
[35]For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you made me welcome,
[35]kuko nari nshonje mukamfungurira, nari mfite inyota mumpa icyo nywa, nari umushyitsi murancumbikira,
[36]lacking clothes and you clothed me, sick and you visited me, in prison and you came to see me."
[36]nari nambaye ubusa muranyambika, nari ndwaye muransūra, nari mu nzu y'imbohe muza kundeba.’
[37]Then the upright will say to him in reply, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?
[37]“Abakiranutsi bazamubaza bati ‘Mwami, twakubonye ryari ushonje turagufungurira, cyangwa ufite inyota tuguha icyo unywa?
[38]When did we see you a stranger and make you welcome, lacking clothes and clothe you?
[38]Kandi twakubonye ryari uri umushyitsi turagucumbikira, cyangwa wambaye ubusa turakwambika?
[39]When did we find you sick or in prison and go to see you?"
[39]Kandi twakubonye ryari urwaye, cyangwa uri mu nzu y'imbohe tuza kugusūra?’
[40]And the King will answer, "In truth I tell you, in so far as you did this to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me."
[40]Umwami azabasubiza ati ‘Ndababwira ukuri yuko ubwo mwabikoreye umwe muri bene Data aba boroheje bari hanyuma y'abandi, ari jye mwabikoreye.’
[41]Then he will say to those on his left hand, "Go away from me, with your curse upon you, to the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
[41]“Azabwira n'abari ibumoso ati ‘Nimuve aho ndi mwa bivume mwe, mujye mu muriro w'iteka watunganirijwe Umwanzi n'abamarayika be,
[42]For I was hungry and you never gave me food, I was thirsty and you never gave me anything to drink,
[42]kuko nari nshonje ntimumfungurire, nari mfite inyota ntimwampa icyo nywa,
[43]I was a stranger and you never made me welcome, lacking clothes and you never clothed me, sick and in prison and you never visited me."
[43]nari umushyitsi ntimwancumbikira, nari nambaye ubusa ntimwanyambika, nari umurwayi no mu nzu y'imbohe ntimwansūra.’
[44]Then it will be their turn to ask, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or lacking clothes, sick or in prison, and did not come to your help?"
[44]“Na bo bazamusubiza bati ‘Mwami, twakubonye ryari ushonje, cyangwa ufite inyota, cyangwa uri umushyitsi, cyangwa wambaye ubusa, cyangwa urwaye, cyangwa uri mu nzu y'imbohe, ntitwagukorera?’
[45]Then he will answer, "In truth I tell you, in so far as you neglected to do this to one of the least of these, you neglected to do it to me."
[45]Azabasubiza ati ‘Ndababwira ukuri yuko ubwo mutabikoreye umwe muri bene Data aba boroheje bari hanyuma y'abandi, nanjye mutabinkoreye.’
[46]And they will go away to eternal punishment, and the upright to eternal life.'
[46]Abo bazajya mu ihaniro ry'iteka, naho abakiranutsi bazajya mu bugingo buhoraho.”

Matthew 26:1-75
Mt 26:1-30,0,31-75
[1]Jesus had now finished all he wanted to say, and he told his disciples,
[1]Nuko Yesu arangije ayo magambo yose abwira abigishwa be ati
[2]'It will be Passover, as you know, in two days' time, and the Son of man will be handed over to be crucified.'
[2]“Muzi yuko iminsi ibiri nishira hazabaho Pasika, Umwana w'umuntu azagambanirwa abambwe.”
[3]Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,
[3]Maze abatambyi bakuru n'abakuru b'ubwo bwoko, bateranira mu rugo rw'Umutambyi mukuru witwaga Kayafa,
[4]and made plans to arrest Jesus by some trick and have him put to death.
[4]bagira inama hamwe yo koshyoshya Yesu ngo babone uko bamufata, bamwice.
[5]They said, however, 'It must not be during the festivities; there must be no disturbance among the people.'
[5]Ariko baravuga bati “Twe kumufata mu minsi mikuru, kugira ngo bidatera abantu imidugararo.”
[6]Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon, a man who had suffered from a virulent skin-disease, when
[6]Yesu ari i Betaniya mu nzu ya Simoni umubembe,
[7]a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and poured it on his head as he was at table.
[7]umugore aza aho ari afite umukondo w'amavuta meza, ameze nk'amadahano y'igiciro cyinshi cyane, ayamusuka ku mutwe yicaye arya.
[8]When they saw this, the disciples said indignantly, 'Why this waste?
[8]Abigishwa babibonye bararakara bati “Aya mavuta apfiriye iki ubusa,
[9]This could have been sold for a high price and the money given the poor.'
[9]ko yajyaga kugurwa impiya nyinshi zigafasha abakene?”
[10]But Jesus noticed this and said, 'Why are you upsetting the woman? What she has done for me is indeed a good work!
[10]Ariko Yesu abimenye arababaza ati “Uyu mugore muramuterera iki agahinda, ko ankoreye umurimo mwiza?
[11]You have the poor with you always, but you will not always have me.
[11]Abakene muri kumwe na bo iteka, ariko jyeweho ntituri kumwe iteka.
[12]When she poured this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
[12]Igitumye uyu mugore ansukaho ayo mavuta ku mubiri, ni ukuwutunganiriza guhambwa.
[13]In truth I tell you, wherever in all the world this gospel is proclaimed, what she has done will be told as well, in remembrance of her.'
[13]Ndababwira ukuri yuko aho ubutumwa bwiza buzigishirizwa hose mu isi yose, icyo uyu mugore ankoreye kizavugirwa kugira ngo bamwibuke.”
[14]Then one of the Twelve, the man called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
[14]Hanyuma umwe muri abo cumi na babiri witwaga Yuda Isikariyota, asanga abatambyi bakuru
[15]and said, 'What are you prepared to give me if I hand him over to you?' They paid him thirty silver pieces,
[15]arababaza ati “Mwampa iki nkamubagenzereza?” Bamugerera ibice by'ifeza mirongo itatu,
[16]and from then onwards he began to look for an opportunity to betray him.
[16]aherako ashaka uburyo yamubagenzereza.
[17]Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus to say, 'Where do you want us to make the preparations for you to eat the Passover?'
[17]Ku munsi wa mbere wo kurya imitsima idasembuwe, abigishwa begera Yesu baramubaza bati “Urashaka ko dutunganiriza he aho uri burīre ibya Pasika?”
[18]He said, 'Go to a certain man in the city and say to him, "The Master says: My time is near. It is at your house that I am keeping Passover with my disciples." '
[18]Arabasubiza ati “Mujye mu murwa kwa ntuza, mumubwire muti ‘Umwigisha aravuze ngo igihe cye kirenda kugera, ngo iwawe ni ho ari busangirire ibya Pasika n'abigishwa be.’ ”
[19]The disciples did what Jesus told them and prepared the Passover.
[19]Abigishwa bagenza uko Yesu yababwiye, baringaniza ibya Pasika.
[20]When evening came he was at table with the Twelve.
[20]Bugorobye yicarana n'abigishwa cumi na babiri ngo basangire.
[21]And while they were eating he said, 'In truth I tell you, one of you is about to betray me.'
[21]Bakirya arababwira ati “Ndababwira ukuri, yuko umwe muri mwe ari bungambanire.”
[22]They were greatly distressed and started asking him in turn, 'Not me, Lord, surely?'
[22]Barababara cyane, baherako bamubaza umwe umwe bati “Mwami, ni jye?”
[23]He answered, 'Someone who has dipped his hand into the dish with me will betray me.
[23]Na we arabasubiza ati “Uwo duhuriza amaboko ku mbehe, ni we uri bungambanire.
[24]The Son of man is going to his fate, as the scriptures say he will, but alas for that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Better for that man if he had never been born!'
[24]Umwana w'umuntu aragenda nk'uko byanditswe kuri we, ariko uwo muntu ugambanira Umwana w'umuntu azabona ishyano, ibyajyaga kumubera byiza ni uko aba ataravutse.”
[25]Judas, who was to betray him, asked in his turn, 'Not me, Rabbi, surely?' Jesus answered, 'It is you who say it.'
[25]Yuda uwo wari ugiye kumugambanira aramubaza ati “Mwigisha, ni jye?”Aramusubiza ati “Wakabimenye.”
[26]Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had said the blessing he broke it and gave it to the disciples. 'Take it and eat,' he said, 'this is my body.'
[26]Bakirya Yesu yenda umutsima arawushimira, arawumanyagura, awuha abigishwa be arababwira ati “Nimwende murye, uyu ni umubiri wanjye.”
[27]Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he handed it to them saying, 'Drink from this, all of you,
[27]Yenda igikombe aragishimira, arakibaha, arababwira ati “Munywere kuri iki mwese,
[28]for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
[28]kuko aya ari amaraso yanjye y'isezerano rishya, ava ku bwa benshi ngo bababarirwe ibyaha.
[29]From now on, I tell you, I shall never again drink wine until the day I drink the new wine with you in the kingdom of my Father.'
[29]Ariko ndababwira rwose yuko ntazanywa ku mbuto z'imizabibu, mpereye none nkageza umunsi nzasangirira namwe vino nshya mu bwami bwa Data.”
[30]After the psalms had been sung they left for the Mount of Olives.
[30]Bamaze kuririmba barasohoka, bajya ku musozi wa Elayono. [0](Mar 14.27-31; Luka 22.31-34; Yoh 13.36-38)
[31]Then Jesus said to them, 'You will all fall away from me tonight, for the scripture says: I shall strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered,
[31]Maze Yesu arababwira ati “Mwebwe mwese iri joro ibyanjye birabahemuza, kuko byanditswe ngo ‘Nzakubita umwungeri, umukumbi w'intama usandare.’
[32]but after my resurrection I shall go ahead of you to Galilee.'
[32]Ariko nimara kuzūrwa, nzababanziriza kujya i Galilaya.”
[33]At this, Peter said to him, 'Even if all fall away from you, I will never fall away.'
[33]Maze Petero aramusubiza ati “Nubwo bose ibyawe biri bubagushe, jyeweho ntabwo bizangusha.”
[34]Jesus answered him, 'In truth I tell you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will have disowned me three times.'
[34]Yesu aramubwira ati “Ndakubwira ukuri yuko muri iri joro, inkoko itarabika uri bunyihakane gatatu.”
[35]Peter said to him, 'Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.' And all the disciples said the same.
[35]Petero aramubwira ati “Naho byatuma mpfana nawe, na bwo sindi bukwihakane na hato.” N'abandi bigishwa bose bavuga batyo.
[36]Then Jesus came with them to a plot of land called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, 'Stay here while I go over there to pray.'
[36]Maze Yesu agerana na bo ahitwa i Getsemani, abwira abigishwa be ati “Nimube mwicaye aha nigire hariya nsenge.”
[37]He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. And he began to feel sadness and anguish.
[37]Ajyana Petero na bene Zebedayo bombi, atangira kubabara no guhagarika umutima cyane.
[38]Then he said to them, 'My soul is sorrowful to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake with me.'
[38]Maze arababwira ati “Umutima wanjye ufite agahinda kenshi kenda kunyica. Mugume hano, mubane maso nanjye.”
[39]And going on a little further he fell on his face and prayed. 'My Father,' he said, 'if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would have it.'
[39]Yigira imbere ho hato arunama, arasenga ati “Data, niba bishoboka iki gikombe kindenge, ariko bye kuba uko jyewe nshaka, ahubwo bibe uko wowe ushaka.”
[40]He came back to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, 'So you had not the strength to stay awake with me for one hour?
[40]Agaruka aho abigishwa bari asanga basinziriye, abaza Petero ati “Harya ntimubashije kubana maso nanjye isaha imwe?
[41]Stay awake, and pray not to be put to the test. The spirit is willing enough, but human nature is weak.'
[41]Mube maso, musenge mutajya mu moshya. Umutima ni wo ukunze, ariko umubiri ufite intege nke.”
[42]Again, a second time, he went away and prayed: 'My Father,' he said, 'if this cup cannot pass by, but I must drink it, your will be done!'
[42]Yongera kugenda ubwa kabiri arasenga ati “Data, niba bidashoboka ko iki kindenga, ngo kereka nkinywereyeho, ibyo ushaka abe ari byo biba.”
[43]And he came back again and found them sleeping, their eyes were so heavy.
[43]Yongeye kugaruka asanga basinziriye, kuko amaso yabo aremereye.
[44]Leaving them there, he went away again and prayed for the third time, repeating the same words.
[44]Arongera abasiga aho aragenda, asenga ubwa gatatu avuga amagambo amwe n'aya mbere.
[45]Then he came back to the disciples and said to them, 'You can sleep on now and have your rest. Look, the hour has come when the Son of man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.
[45]Maze agaruka aho abigishwa bari arababwira ati “Musinzire noneho, muruhuke. Dore igihe kirenda gusohora, Umwana w'umuntu agambaniwe mu maboko y'abanyabyaha.
[46]Get up! Let us go! Look, my betrayer is not far away.'
[46]Nimubyuke tugende, dore ungenza ari hafi.”
[47]And suddenly while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared, and with him a large number of men armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.
[47]Akibivuga, Yuda umwe muri abo cumi na babiri azana n'igitero kinini gifite inkota n'inshyimbo, giturutse ku batambyi bakuru n'abakuru b'ubwo bwoko.
[48]Now the traitor had arranged a sign with them saying, 'The one I kiss, he is the man. Arrest him.'
[48]Ariko umugambanira yari yabahaye ikimenyetso ati “Uwo ndi busome, ni we uwo mumufate.”
[49]So he went up to Jesus at once and said, 'Greetings, Rabbi,' and kissed him.
[49]Uwo mwanya yegera Yesu aramubwira ati “Ni amahoro Mwigisha”, aramusomagura.
[50]Jesus said to him, 'My friend, do what you are here for.' Then they came forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.
[50]Yesu aramubwira ati “Mugenzi wanjye, kora ikikuzanye.”Maze baraza basumira Yesu, baramufata.
[51]And suddenly, one of the followers of Jesus grasped his sword and drew it; he struck the high priest's servant and cut off his ear.
[51]Umwe muri abo bari kumwe na Yesu arambura ukuboko, akura inkota ye, ayikubita umugaragu w'Umutambyi mukuru, amuca ugutwi.
[52]Jesus then said, 'Put your sword back, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.
[52]Maze Yesu aramubwira ati “Subiza inkota yawe mu rwubati rwayo, kuko abatwara inkota bose bazicwa n'inkota.
[53]Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, who would promptly send more than twelve legions of angels to my defence?
[53]Mbese wibwira yuko ntabasha gusaba Data, akanyoherereza abamarayika nonaha basāga legiyoni cumi n'ebyiri?
[54]But then, how would the scriptures be fulfilled that say this is the way it must be?'
[54]Ariko rero bibaye bityo, ibyanditswe byasohora bite kandi ari ko bikwiriye kuba?”
[55]It was at this time that Jesus said to the crowds, 'Am I a bandit, that you had to set out to capture me with swords and clubs? I sat teaching in the Temple day after day and you never laid a hand on me.'
[55]Uwo mwanya Yesu abaza igitero ati “Harya muhurujwe no kumfata nk'uko muzira umwambuzi, mufite inkota n'inshyimbo? Nicaraga mu rusengero iminsi yose nigisha, kuki mutamfashe?
[56]Now all this happened to fulfil the prophecies in scripture. Then all the disciples deserted him and ran away.
[56]Ariko ibi byose bibereyeho kugira ngo ibyanditswe n'abahanuzi bisohore.”Nuko abigishwa bose baramuhāna, barahunga.
[57]The men who had arrested Jesus led him off to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
[57]Abafashe Yesu bamujyana kwa Kayafa Umutambyi mukuru, ari ho abanditsi n'abakuru bari bateraniye.
[58]Peter followed him at a distance right to the high priest's palace, and he went in and sat down with the attendants to see what the end would be.
[58]Petero amukurikira arenga ahinguka agera ku rugo rw'Umutambyi mukuru, arujyamo yicarana n'abagaragu ngo arebe amaherezo.
[59]The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus, however false, on which they might have him executed.
[59]Maze abatambyi bakuru n'abanyarukiko bose bashaka Yesu ho ibirego by'ibinyoma ngo babone uko bamwica,
[60]But they could not find any, though several lying witnesses came forward. Eventually two came forward
[60]barabibura nubwo haje abagabo b'ibinyoma benshi. Hanyuma haza babiri
[61]and made a statement, 'This man said, "I have power to destroy the Temple of God and in three days build it up." '
[61]baravuga bati “Uyu yagize ngo yabasha gusenya urusengero rw'Imana, akarwubaka mu minsi itatu.”
[62]The high priest then rose and said to him, 'Have you no answer to that? What is this evidence these men are bringing against you?'
[62]Umutambyi mukuru arahaguruka aramubaza ati “Ntiwiregura na hato? Ntiwumvise ibyo aba bakureze?”
[63]But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, 'I put you on oath by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.'
[63]Yesu aricecekera. Umutambyi mukuru aramubwira ati “Nkurahirije Imana ihoraho, tubwire niba ari wowe Kristo, Umwana w'Imana.”
[64]Jesus answered him, 'It is you who say it. But, I tell you that from this time onward you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.'
[64]Yesu aramusubiza ati “Wakabimenye, kandi ndababwira yuko hanyuma muzabona Umwana w'umuntu yicaye iburyo bw'ubushobozi bw'Imana, aje ku bicu byo mu ijuru.”
[65]Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, 'He has blasphemed. What need of witnesses have we now? There! You have just heard the blasphemy.
[65]Umutambyi mukuru abyumvise atyo ashishimura imyenda ye ati “Arigereranije. Turacyashakira iki abagabo? Dore noneho mwiyumviye kwigereranya kwe.
[66]What is your opinion?' They answered, 'He deserves to die.'
[66]Muratekereza iki?”Baramusubiza bati “Akwiriye kwicwa.”
[67]Then they spat in his face and hit him with their fists; others said as they struck him,
[67]Nuko bamucira amacandwe mu maso, bamukubita ibipfunsi, abandi bamukubita inshyi bati
[68]'Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you then?'
[68]“Duhanure Kristo, ni nde ugukubise?”
[69]Meanwhile Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came up to him saying, 'You, too, were with Jesus the Galilean.'
[69]Ubwo Petero yari yicaye hanze mu rugo, umuja aramwegera aramubwira ati “Nawe wari kumwe na Yesu w'Umunyagalilaya.”
[70]But he denied it in front of them all. 'I do not know what you are talking about,' he said.
[70]Maze abihakanira imbere ya bose ati “Ibyo uvuze sinzi ibyo ari byo.”
[71]When he went out to the gateway another servant-girl saw him and said to the people there, 'This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.'
[71]Arasohoka ageze mu bikingi by'amarembo undi muja aramubona, abwira abahari ati “N'uyu yari kumwe na Yesu w'i Nazareti.”
[72]And again, with an oath, he denied it, 'I do not know the man.'
[72]Yongera kubihakana arahira ati “Uwo muntu simuzi.”
[73]A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, 'You are certainly one of them too! Why, your accent gives you away.'
[73]Hashize umwanya muto, abari bahagaze aho baraza babwira Petero bati “Ni ukuri nawe uri umwe muri bo, ndetse ni imvugo yawe irakumenyekanishije.”
[74]Then he started cursing and swearing, 'I do not know the man.' And at once the cock crowed,
[74]Maze atangira kwivuma no kurahira ati “Uwo muntu simuzi.”Muri ako kanya inkoko irabika.
[75]and Peter remembered what Jesus had said, 'Before the cock crows you will have disowned me three times.' And he went outside and wept bitterly.
[75]Petero yibuka ijambo Yesu yari yavuze ati “Inkoko itarabika uri bunyihakane gatatu.” Arasohoka ararira cyane.

Matthew 27:1-66
Mt 27:1-66
[1]When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people met in council to bring about the death of Jesus.
[1]Umuseke utambitse, abatambyi bakuru bose n'abakuru b'ubwo bwoko bigīra inama yo kwica Yesu.
[2]They had him bound and led him away to hand him over to Pilate, the governor.
[2]Baramuboha, baramujyana bamushyira umutegeka Pilato.
[3]When he found that Jesus had been condemned, then Judas, his betrayer, was filled with remorse and took the thirty silver pieces back to the chief priests and elders
[3]Maze Yuda wamugambaniye abonye ko urubanza rutsinze Yesu, aricuza asubiza abatambyi bakuru n'abakuru bya bice by'ifeza mirongo itatu ati
[4]saying, 'I have sinned. I have betrayed innocent blood.' They replied, 'What is that to us? That is your concern.'
[4]“Nakoze icyaha, kuko nagambaniye amaraso atariho urubanza.”Ariko bo baramusubiza bati “Biramaze! Ni ibyawe.”
[5]And flinging down the silver pieces in the sanctuary he made off, and went and hanged himself.
[5]Ifeza azijugunya mu rusengero arasohoka, aragenda arimanika.
[6]The chief priests picked up the silver pieces and said, 'It is against the Law to put this into the treasury; it is blood-money.'
[6]Ariko abatambyi bakuru bajyana bya bice by'ifeza baravuga bati “Amategeko ntiyemera ko tubishyira mu bubiko bw'Imana, kuko ari ibiguzi by'amaraso.”
[7]So they discussed the matter and with it bought the potter's field as a graveyard for foreigners,
[7]Bajya inama bazigura isambu y'umubumbyi, ngo ijye ihambwamo abashyitsi.
[8]and this is why the field is still called the Field of Blood.
[8]Ni cyo gituma iyo sambu yitwa Isambu y'amaraso na bugingo n'ubu.
[9]The word spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was then fulfilled: And they took the thirty silver pieces, the sum at which the precious One was priced by the children of Israel,
[9]Ni bwo ibyavuzwe n'umuhanuzi Yeremiya byasohoye ngo “Bajyanye ibice by'ifeza mirongo itatu, ari cyo giciro cy'uwo baciriye, uwo bamwe mu Bisirayeli baciriye,
[10]and they gave them for the potter's field, just as the Lord directed me.
[10]babigura isambu y'umubumbyi nk'uko Uwiteka yanyeretse.”
[11]Jesus, then, was brought before the governor, and the governor put to him this question, 'Are you the king of the Jews?' Jesus replied, 'It is you who say it.'
[11]Ubwo Yesu yari ahagaze imbere y'umutegeka. Umutegeka aramubaza ati “Ni wowe mwami w'Abayuda?”Yesu aramusubiza ati “Wakabimenye.”
[12]But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders he refused to answer at all.
[12]Abatambyi bakuru n'abakuru baramurega, ariko ntiyagira icyo yireguza na hato.
[13]Pilate then said to him, 'Do you not hear how many charges they have made against you?'
[13]Maze Pilato aramubaza ati “Ntiwumvise ko bagushinje byinshi?”
[14]But to the governor's amazement, he offered not a word in answer to any of the charges.
[14]Ariko ntiyamusubiza ijambo na rimwe, bituma umutegeka yumirwa cyane.
[15]At festival time it was the governor's practice to release a prisoner for the people, anyone they chose.
[15]Muri iyo minsi mikuru, uko umwaka utashye umutegeka yagiraga akamenyero ko kubohorera abantu imbohe imwe, iyo bashakaga.
[16]Now there was then a notorious prisoner whose name was Barabbas.
[16]Icyo gihe bari bafite imbohe y'ikimenywabose, yitwaga Baraba.
[17]So when the crowd gathered, Pilate said to them, 'Which do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?'
[17]Nuko bateranye Pilato arababaza ati “Uwo mushaka ko mbabohorera ni nde? Ni Baraba, cyangwa ni Yesu witwa Kristo?”
[18]For Pilate knew it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over.
[18]Kuko yamenye yuko ishyari ari ryo rimubatangishije.
[19]Now as he was seated in the chair of judgement, his wife sent him a message, 'Have nothing to do with that upright man; I have been extremely upset today by a dream that I had about him.'
[19]Kandi ubwo yari yicaye ku ntebe y'imanza, umugore we amutumaho ati “Ntugire icyo utwara uwo mukiranutsi, kuko naraye ndose byinshi kuri we byambabaje.”
[20]The chief priests and the elders, however, had persuaded the crowd to demand the release of Barabbas and the execution of Jesus.
[20]Ariko abatambyi bakuru n'abakuru boshya abantu ngo basabe Baraba, bicishe Yesu.
[21]So when the governor spoke and asked them, 'Which of the two do you want me to release for you?' they said, 'Barabbas.'
[21]Nuko umutegeka yongera kubabaza ati “Muri abo bombi, uwo mushaka ni nde nkamubabohorera?”Bati “Ni Baraba.”
[22]Pilate said to them, 'But in that case, what am I to do with Jesus who is called Christ?' They all said, 'Let him be crucified!'
[22]Pilato arabasubiza ati “Yesu witwa Kristo ndamugira nte?”Bose bati “Nabambwe!”
[23]He asked, 'But what harm has he done?' But they shouted all the louder, 'Let him be crucified!'
[23]Na we arababaza ati “Kuki? Yakoze cyaha ki?”Ariko barushaho gusakuza cyane bati “Nabambwe!”
[24]Then Pilate saw that he was making no impression, that in fact a riot was imminent. So he took some water, washed his hands in front of the crowd and said, 'I am innocent of this man's blood. It is your concern.'
[24]Nuko Pilato abonye ko arushywa n'ubusa, ahubwo ko barushijeho gushega, yenda amazi akarabira imbere y'abantu ati “Jyeweho nta cyaha kindiho ku bw'amaraso y'uyu mukiranutsi, birabe ibyanyu.”
[25]And the people, every one of them, shouted back, 'Let his blood be on us and on our children!'
[25]Abantu bose baramusubiza bati “Amaraso ye natubeho no ku bana bacu.”
[26]Then he released Barabbas for them. After having Jesus scourged he handed him over to be crucified.
[26]Maze ababohorera Baraba, ariko amaze gukubita Yesu imikoba, aramutanga ngo abambwe.
[27]Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus with them into the Praetorium and collected the whole cohort round him.
[27]Maze abasirikare b'umutegeka bajyana Yesu mu rukiko, bamuteraniranirizaho ingabo zose.
[28]And they stripped him and put a scarlet cloak round him,
[28]Baramucuza, bamwambika umwenda w'umuhemba,
[29]and having twisted some thorns into a crown they put this on his head and placed a reed in his right hand. To make fun of him they knelt to him saying, 'Hail, king of the Jews!'
[29]baboha ikamba ry'amahwa barimwambika mu mutwe, n'urubingo mu kuboko kwe kw'iburyo baramupfukamira, baramushinyagurira bati “Ni amahoro, mwami w'Abayuda!”
[30]And they spat on him and took the reed and struck him on the head with it.
[30]Bamucira amacandwe, benda rwa rubingo barumukubita mu mutwe.
[31]And when they had finished making fun of him, they took off the cloak and dressed him in his own clothes and led him away to crucifixion.
[31]Bamaze kumushinyagurira bamwambura wa mwenda, bamwambika imyenda ye bamujyana kumubamba.
[32]On their way out, they came across a man from Cyrene, called Simon, and enlisted him to carry his cross.
[32]Bagisohoka, bahura n'Umunyakurene witwaga Simoni, uwo bamuhata kujyana na bo ngo yikorere umusaraba wa Yesu.
[33]When they had reached a place called Golgotha, that is, the place of the skull,
[33]Bageze ahitwa i Gologota, hasobanurwa ngo i Nyabihanga,
[34]they gave him wine to drink mixed with gall, which he tasted but refused to drink.
[34]bamuha vino ivanze n'indurwe ngo anywe, asogongeye yanga kuyinywa.
[35]When they had finished crucifying him they shared out his clothing by casting lots,
[35]Bamaze kumubamba, bagabana imyenda ye, barayifindira,
[36]and then sat down and stayed there keeping guard over him.
[36]bicara aho baramurinda.
[37]Above his head was placed the charge against him; it read: 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.'
[37]Bashyira hejuru y'umutwe we ibirego bamureze, byanditswe ngo “UYU NI YESU, UMWAMI W'ABAYUDA.”
[38]Then two bandits were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.
[38]Maze abambuzi babiri bababambana na we, umwe iburyo bwe undi ibumoso.
[39]The passers-by jeered at him; they shook their heads
[39]Abahisi baramutuka, bamuzunguriza imitwe
[40]and said, 'So you would destroy the Temple and in three days rebuild it! Then save yourself if you are God's son and come down from the cross!'
[40]baravuga bati “Wowe usenya urusengero ukarwubaka mu minsi itatu, ikize. Niba uri Umwana w'Imana, manuka uve ku musaraba.”
[41]The chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked him in the same way,
[41]Abatambyi bakuru n'abanditsi n'abakuru na bo bashinyagura batyo bati
[42]with the words, 'He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the king of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.
[42]“Yakijije abandi, ntabasha kwikiza. Ko ari umwami w'Abisirayeli, namanuke ave ku musaraba nonaha, natwe turamwemera.
[43]He has put his trust in God; now let God rescue him if he wants him. For he did say, "I am God's son." '
[43]Yiringiye Imana, ngaho nimukize nonaha, niba imukunda kuko yavuze ati ‘Ndi Umwana w'Imana.’ ”
[44]Even the bandits who were crucified with him taunted him in the same way.
[44]N'abambuzi babambanywe na we, na bo bamutuka batyo.
[45]From the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
[45]Uhereye ku isaha ya gatandatu haba ubwirakabiri mu gihugu cyose kugeza ku isaha ya cyenda.
[46]And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?' that is, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'
[46]Maze ku isaha ya cyenda Yesu avuga ijwi rirenga ati “Eli, Eli, lama sabakitani?” Bisobanurwa ngo “Mana yanjye, Mana yanjye, ni iki kikundekesheje?”
[47]When some of those who stood there heard this, they said, 'The man is calling on Elijah,'
[47]Ariko bamwe mu bari bahagaze aho babyumvise baravuga bati “Umva wa mugabo arahamagara Eliya.”
[48]and one of them quickly ran to get a sponge which he filled with vinegar and, putting it on a reed, gave it him to drink.
[48]Uwo mwanya umwe muri bo arirukanka, yenda sipongo ayuzuza inzoga isharira, ayishyira ku rubingo arayimushomesha.
[49]But the rest of them said, 'Wait! And see if Elijah will come to save him.'
[49]Ariko abandi bati “Ba uretse turebe ko Eliya aza kumukiza.”
[50]But Jesus, again crying out in a loud voice, yielded up his spirit.
[50]Ariko Yesu yongera kuvuga ijwi rirenga, aratanga.
[51]And suddenly, the veil of the Sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth quaked, the rocks were split,
[51]Umwenda ukingiriza Ahera cyane h'urusengero utabukamo kabiri, utangirira hejuru ugeza hasi, isi iratigita, ibitare birameneka,
[52]the tombs opened and the bodies of many holy people rose from the dead,
[52]ibituro birakinguka, intumbi nyinshi z'abera bari barasinziriye zirazurwa,
[53]and these, after his resurrection, came out of the tombs, entered the holy city and appeared to a number of people.
[53]bava mu bituro, maze amaze kuzuka binjira mu murwa wera, babonekera benshi.
[54]The centurion, together with the others guarding Jesus, had seen the earthquake and all that was taking place, and they were terrified and said, 'In truth this man was son of God.'
[54]Umutware utwara umutwe w'abasirikare n'abari kumwe na we barinda Yesu, babonye igishyitsi n'ibibaye baratinya cyane bati “Ni ukuri, uyu yari Umwana w'Imana.”
[55]And many women were there, watching from a distance, the same women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and looked after him.
[55]Hariho n'abagore benshi bari bahagaze kure bareba, ni bo bakurikiye Yesu ava i Galilaya, baramukorera.
[56]Among them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
[56]Muri bo harimo Mariya Magadalena, na Mariya nyina wa Yakobo na Yosefu, na nyina wa bene Zebedayo.
[57]When it was evening, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, called Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
[57]Nuko nimugoroba haza umuntu w'umutunzi wo muri Arimataya witwaga Yosefu, kandi na we yari umwigishwa wa Yesu.
[58]This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be handed over.
[58]Uwo ajya kwa Pilato asaba intumbi ya Yesu, maze Pilato ategeka ko bayimuha.
[59]So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean shroud
[59]Yosefu ajyana intumbi, ayizingira mu mwenda w'igitare wera,
[60]and put it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock. He then rolled a large stone across the entrance of the tomb and went away.
[60]ayishyira mu mva ye nshya, iyo yakorogoshoye mu rutare, abirindurira igitare ku munwa w'imva, aragenda.
[61]Now Mary of Magdala and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the sepulchre.
[61]Mariya Magadalena na Mariya wundi bari bahari bicaye berekeye imva.
[62]Next day, that is, when Preparation Day was over, the chief priests and the Pharisees went in a body to Pilate
[62]Nuko bukeye bwaho, ari wo munsi wakurikiraga uwo Kwitegura, abatambyi bakuru n'Abafarisayo bateranira kwa Pilato.
[63]and said to him, 'Your Excellency, we recall that this impostor said, while he was still alive, "After three days I shall rise again."
[63]Baramubwira bati “Mutware, twibutse yuko wa mubeshyi akiri muzima yagize ngo iminsi itatu nishira azazuka.
[64]Therefore give the order to have the sepulchre kept secure until the third day, for fear his disciples come and steal him away and tell the people, "He has risen from the dead." This last piece of fraud would be worse than what went before.'
[64]Nuko tegeka barinde igituro cyane bazageze ku munsi wa gatatu, kugira ngo abigishwa be bataza kumwiba bakabwira abantu ngo arazutse, maze kuyoba kwa nyuma kukaruta ukwa mbere.”
[65]Pilate said to them, 'You may have your guard; go and make all as secure as you know how.'
[65]Pilato arababwira ati “Ngaba abarinzi, nimugende mukirindishe uko mubizi.”
[66]So they went and made the sepulchre secure, putting seals on the stone and mounting a guard.
[66]Na bo baragenda barindisha igituro, bahoma ubushishi ku gitare kugira ngo bagiteranye n'umunwa w'igituro, babushyiraho ikimenyetso abarinzi bahari.

Matthew 28:1-20
Mt 28:1-20
[1]After the Sabbath, and towards dawn on the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary went to visit the sepulchre.
[1]Nuko umunsi w'isabato ushize, ku wa mbere w'iminsi irindwi, umuseke wenda gutambika, Mariya Magadalena na Mariya wundi bajya kureba cya gituro.
[2]And suddenly there was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat on it.
[2]Habaho igishyitsi cyinshi, kuko marayika w'Umwami Imana yari amanutse avuye mu ijuru, abirindura igitare acyicaraho.
[3]His face was like lightning, his robe white as snow.
[3]Ishusho ye yasaga n'umurabyo, n'imyenda ye yeraga nk'urubura.
[4]The guards were so shaken by fear of him that they were like dead men.
[4]Ba barinzi bamubonye bagira ubwoba bahinda imishitsi, basa n'abapfuye.
[5]But the angel spoke; and he said to the women, 'There is no need for you to be afraid. I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
[5]Ariko marayika abwira abagore ati “Mwebweho mwitinya, kuko nzi yuko mushaka Yesu wabambwe.
[6]He is not here, for he has risen, as he said he would. Come and see the place where he lay,
[6]Ntari hano kuko yazutse nk'uko yavuze, nimuze murebe aho Umwami yari aryamye.
[7]then go quickly and tell his disciples, "He has risen from the dead and now he is going ahead of you to Galilee; that is where you will see him." Look! I have told you.'
[7]Nimugende vuba mubwire abigishwa be yuko yazutse, kandi azababanziriza kujya i Galilaya. Iyo ni ho muzamubonera dore ndabibabwiye.”
[8]Filled with awe and great joy the women came quickly away from the tomb and ran to tell his disciples.
[8]Bava mu gituro vuba bafite ubwoba n'ibinezaneza byinshi, birukanka bajya kubibwira abigishwa be.
[9]And suddenly, coming to meet them, was Jesus. 'Greetings,' he said. And the women came up to him and, clasping his feet, they did him homage.
[9]Maze Yesu ahura na bo arababwira ati “Ni amahoro!” Baramwegera bamufata ku birenge, baramupfukamira.
[10]Then Jesus said to them, 'Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers that they must leave for Galilee; there they will see me.'
[10]Maze Yesu arababwira ati “Mwitinya, nimugende mubwire bene Data bajye i Galilaya, ni ho bazambonera.”
[11]Now while they were on their way, some of the guards went off into the city to tell the chief priests all that had happened.
[11]Bakigenda, bamwe muri ba barinzi bajya mu murwa babwira abatambyi bakuru ibyabaye byose.
[12]These held a meeting with the elders and, after some discussion, handed a considerable sum of money to the soldiers
[12]Bateranira hamwe n'abakuru bajya inama, bagurira abasirikare ifeza nyinshi
[13]with these instructions, 'This is what you must say, "His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep."
[13]bati “Mujye muvuga muti ‘Abigishwa be baje nijoro dusinziriye, baramwiba.’
[14]And should the governor come to hear of this, we undertake to put things right with him ourselves and to see that you do not get into trouble.'
[14]Umutegeka naramuka abyumvise tuzamwemeza, namwe tuzabakiza amakuba.”
[15]So they took the money and carried out their instructions, and to this day that is the story among the Jews.
[15]Nuko baherako bijyanira ifeza, babigenza uko bohejwe. Iryo jambo ryamamara mu Bayuda na bugingo n'ubu.
[16]Meanwhile the eleven disciples set out for Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had arranged to meet them.
[16]Nuko abigishwa cumi n'umwe bajya i Galilaya ku musozi Yesu yabategetse.
[17]When they saw him they fell down before him, though some hesitated.
[17]Bamubonye baramupfukamira, ariko bamwe barashidikanya.
[18]Jesus came up and spoke to them. He said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[18]Nuko Yesu arabegera avugana na bo ati “Nahawe ubutware bwose mu ijuru no mu isi.
[19]Go, therefore, make disciples of all nations; baptise them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[19]Nuko mugende muhindure abantu bo mu mahanga yose abigishwa, mubabatiza mu izina rya Data wa twese n'Umwana n'Umwuka Wera,
[20]and teach them to observe all the commands I gave you. And look, I am with you always; yes, to the end of time.'
[20]mubigisha kwitondera ibyo nababwiye byose. Kandi dore ndi kumwe namwe iminsi yose kugeza ku mperuka y'isi.”
